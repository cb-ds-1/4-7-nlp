candycrush,au,1.196.0.1,2,I enjoy Candy Crush - great stress reliever - but since when is it okay to not win gold bars for winning the episode races??
candycrush,au,1.196.0.1,1,"This games chances of winning are more up and down that a roller coaster, not fun when you get stuck on the same level with 1 life every 30 minutes for a week. Especially with your pay to win for the gold bars I‚Äôm not buying a single thing in your pointless game you don‚Äôt deserve my money lol"
candycrush,au,1.196.0.1,1,"I just lost all my boosters I was stock piling, almost 20 pre game ones each and several in game boosters including the sugar crush pi√±ata and I am unable to access any support because I won them over months playing the game instead of purchasing these ones. Ridiculous and terrible service."
candycrush,au,1.196.0.1,5,Amazing
candycrush,au,1.196.0.1,5,Yes
candycrush,au,1.196.0.1,3,"I had to break my addiction to Toon Blast after 5000 levels. I deleted it and started playing this. I don‚Äôt really understand what I‚Äôm trying to do. The daily bonuses or whatever have no meaning for me, and I‚Äôm not buying anything at all. I‚Äôm hopeful it will remain something to waste some time on for a few minutes and I won‚Äôt get obsessed with it because I was seriously spending too long on the other game."
candycrush,au,1.196.0.1,5,It‚Äôs good game
candycrush,au,1.195.1.1,3,"Long time player but lately I‚Äôve noticed that when I win prizes (from lucky bean tree) they don‚Äôt work, eg. won 60min of choc bomb and when I go and play the choc bomb or fish etc not working and still on zero, and now got to wait another 24hour to try the bean tree if it still available."
candycrush,au,1.195.1.1,3,The support page will not allow me lodge a complaint and I am getting spammed by a former fb friend with life requests. Support page says it won‚Äôt happen if they are deleted on my fb but it‚Äôs still happening
candycrush,au,1.195.1.1,1,"The makers have taken any bonuses, incentives and free spins away to force you for most bonuses to pay.
Not a good move."
candycrush,au,1.195.1.1,5,Ggh
candycrush,au,1.195.1.1,1,I‚Äôve recently updated and can no longer get into this game.
candycrush,au,1.195.1.1,1,Your game is freezing! Fix it please.
candycrush,au,1.194.0.2,5,Been playing this game now for 3 years. Never been more addicted to a game like this in my life. Fortunately I‚Äôm one of the best playing this but for some reason the game has stopped working and I can‚Äôt upgrade or download further developments. Wondering if there‚Äôs a glitch or has something gone wrong. Hopefully it‚Äôs only temporary and I can continue my way up the leaderboard
candycrush,au,1.194.0.2,5,Guys shrek is doing the renegade omg
candycrush,au,1.194.0.2,2,"Way to many screens that pop up between levels I‚Äôm forever closing screens! One for the level, one for the race, one for the piggy bank, and it goes on. Please it‚Äôs ridiculous..."
candycrush,au,1.194.0.2,5,I enjoy the game
candycrush,au,1.194.0.2,1,Every time I start the app the game doesn‚Äôt load. It will just hang at the main page. This happened since yesterday. Pls rectify
candycrush,au,1.194.0.2,1,Can‚Äôt open app
candycrush,au,1.194.0.2,1,"The reward system has been ruined with passing levels, put it back how it was a year ago"
candycrush,au,1.194.0.2,1,So stupid game

candycrush,au,1.194.0.2,1,"Just deleted it after three days of playing. 1 star is too good for this game. Disgusting stupid animation, annoying pop up windows (you need to close 5-6 to start a new level), fake challenges (I won 15 in a row). Boring and time consuming. Nothing to enjoy actually"
candycrush,au,1.194.0.2,1,"Move on to another game, this used to be a relaxing fun game but it has changed. You now have to play a level 30 times before it is possible to finish it and move to the next level. I find it very inconsistent. Move on to something else. Boring Boring
Mind of it‚Äôs own, makes up own moves."
candycrush,au,1.194.0.2,4,"Its a pretty good game when your stressed or bored, but it can get pretty boring and you might end up just deleting it. 
I‚Äôve had it for about a year now, but I havent played it for so long, but now i came back to play it, and i can still see all my progress from a year ago! So i dont reccomend deleting it because later you might want to play it again, so when you do, you‚Äôll find all your progress! Great game üëçüèª! 
4 stars is still fantastic!üòÅ"
candycrush,au,1.194.0.2,3,Please bring back the free spin option
candycrush,au,1.194.0.2,3,Very annoying when unable to close an ad to resume game
candycrush,au,1.194.0.2,5,Coolllll
candycrush,au,1.193.0.2,1,HOW DO I STOP GETTING SO MANY REQUESTS FOR LIVES FROM THE SAME PEOPLE? THIS IS DRIVING ME INSANE. I GET UP IN THE MORNING AND THERES 15 REQUESTS FROM ONE PERSON!
candycrush,au,1.193.0.2,3,"It‚Äôs a good time waster for a game. I have noted glitches when playing. For example, when I had a ‚Äúconveyer belt‚Äù where it moved a purple candy wrapper next to a red candy wrapper they went off together. So regardless of strategy, in this instance, the algorithm decided that they had to explode when there wasn‚Äôt any cause for them to. It really feels like it‚Äôs rigged for addictive purpose rather than problem solving and strategy."
candycrush,au,1.193.0.2,5,"Candy crush is my favorite thing to do! But I have a few suggestions.. have an undo move as a booster - many times I‚Äôm too quick and realize I have moved the wrong candy, be able to store to use when your ready the free lives for level up or free 1hr boosters - many times these are wasted as you either already have 5 lives and cannot accumulate more or you run out of lives as you get the timed boosters. Thanks, keep up the great work!"
candycrush,au,1.193.0.2,2,"When I Was Playing Your Game, Like I‚Äôm On High Levels 3412.Every Levels It Took Me Almost 1 Month Like The Hard Levels.And Last Time I Have The Worst Level Ever, Level 1441, The Level Cant Use Powers Ups That Needs To Candies To Go Up Not Down.BECAUSE I HAVE STUCK ON THAT LEVEL FOR 8 MONTHS.And It Only Got 9 Moves.So At Now Level 3412 It Was Hard Even They Were Not Hard Levels.Please Make The Levels Easier.But Is A Fun Games.So Now I Don‚Äôt Really Enjoy It.And 1441 Made Me Loss $2.99 Dollars For Just 1 Level Why"
candycrush,au,1.193.0.2,3,"Please get rid of the ads which have no sound, mute your music, and give you NO ABILITY to turn your music back on. 30 seconds of silence is more annoying than it sounds. FFS!"
candycrush,au,1.193.0.2,5,Love this app
candycrush,au,1.192.0.1,2,Can‚Äôt get game on my iPad very disappointed been playing since day one
candycrush,au,1.192.0.1,1,How many 12 year olds or younger watch a 30 second ad about seniors card and then how many dollars you get per second don‚Äôt worry about reviewing games spend time doing everything else dumb asses
candycrush,au,1.192.0.1,5,It‚Äôs good
candycrush,au,1.192.0.1,1,Level 5925 and it crashed and won‚Äôt open. Why?? üò©ü§¨
candycrush,au,1.192.0.1,4,Good
candycrush,au,1.192.0.1,1,I had to download this game again after I reached Level 1200. I just couldn‚Äôt get back into my current game. So back to level 1. Probably won‚Äôt continue on with this game. üò°
candycrush,au,1.192.0.1,1,I have got up to level 3000 twice and for some reason it went back to level 1. I‚Äôm so disappointed that this has happy again. Can I retrieve my old games.
candycrush,au,1.192.0.1,5,This game doesn‚Äôt even have ADS. I am seriously done with all of those other games who have ads because I just want to play a game. This is also an offline game so you can play it wherever you want. This game is so addicting. Play it because it‚Äôs enjoyable. I have spent the whole afternoon playing this game and I am literally obsessed with it. I recommend you to play it because you‚Äôll enjoy it. PLEASE AND THANK YOU ;)
candycrush,au,1.192.0.1,3,"I have found now I am in the 4000 that is just luck if you pass 
I blog and all you read is how they now have less moves from when the video was made and making it harder so you get to the stage you just wait till you give us an easy board so I just go of and play other games     because we run out of time and it takes to long to fill up also you loose a move if you don‚Äôt want to play that one you don‚Äôt seem interested in keeping people  interested in staying with the game like when I fist joined we had a long time to play before you logged us out 
It use to be my number one game but not anymore sad"
candycrush,au,1.192.0.1,1,Stop popping up and stopping me from playing other games. üò°üò°please stop popping up adverts in between games. Really annoying.
candycrush,au,1.192.0.1,1,"This is ridiculous. As soon as I spent money the game crashed and I can‚Äôt open it, as soon as I try the app shuts down immediately.

Completely wasted my money."
candycrush,au,1.192.0.1,5,Despite the frequent in app purchase requests and so so music this is a really fun game. And a must have if you like puzzle games.
candycrush,au,1.192.0.1,1,"For a week it would frieze and disable my iPad. For last two days  it will not open at all on my iPad - works fine on iPhone. 
Have reported the issue - no response. 
I‚Äôm tempted to delete and forget."
candycrush,au,1.191.0.2,1,"I‚Äôve just deleted your stupid game. Every add for your stupid game that I am forced to watch from here on in I will be sending you an invoice for $4.50 AU. The people who are responsible for this game are a pack of robbers, disgusting, go and get a real fickin job ya scum bags"
candycrush,au,1.191.0.2,3,WTH level 8349 40 moves now only 20 and a super skull level
candycrush,au,1.191.0.2,1,Great game thoroughly enjoy playing but I would like have the option of retrieving lives that have been sent to me. At the moment can send request but once you have claimed one I am unable to go back please fix this issue. I have tried several times of uninstalling this app but still cannot receive any sent lives. I use an iPad which is the only device. My envelope is grey out all the time. I followed your advice to fix this issue but still hasn‚Äôt work. The makers or candy crush don‚Äôt even respond to request via email. Disappointed is al I can say.
candycrush,au,1.191.0.2,1,"As you progress through the game the nightmare levels can only be passed if you purchase your way through them. Disappointing to find this out by getting stuck on impossible levels to pass. Have deleted for good, this game is a cash grab."
candycrush,au,1.191.0.2,5,Love it üëçüèª
candycrush,au,1.191.0.2,1,No longer worth playing
candycrush,au,1.191.0.2,5,Love the game just start playing can't put it
candycrush,au,1.191.0.2,5,Good to have some time out
candycrush,au,1.190.0.2,1,Loved this game for ages but it is getting too hard to pass levels.  No incentives given really.  Too hard to earn gold bars.  Now the free spin has gone to give extra moves to pass a level not happy.  Feel like giving this game the boot :(
candycrush,au,1.190.0.2,4,Do good
candycrush,au,1.189.0.2,5,"Great game, frustrating once you get in to the higher levels but so worth it! A game you can play without spending money if you don‚Äôt want to! No need to ‚Äúpay‚Äù to unlock levels, of course there are options to pay for things but playable without $$ which is rare in games now! On level 4115 and still enjoying it more and more!
Worth a download"
candycrush,au,1.189.0.2,1,What happened to all my friends playing candy crush. Used to be about 40 now only 17. Also bring  back the icons to collect candies. You have it made uninteresting now. Also why can‚Äôt I get the chocolate box when others can. Very disappointed. You probably won‚Äôt answer me as usual
candycrush,au,1.189.0.2,1,I hope the creator n everyone involved in this stupid game this with covid or cancer.
candycrush,au,1.189.0.2,5,I love lol the levels it is amazing
candycrush,au,1.189.0.2,1,"Generally speaking it‚Äôs a fun game and is visually appealing but like so many others have said, they are nothing but a money hungry bunch of scammers. If this game was subject to Aus law it would be investigated and fined heavily. It‚Äôs no coincidence that more often than not you are one or two plays away from clearing a level. And heed my warning: once you pay, and yes I‚Äôve made that mistake, it will miraculously become even harder which is also no coincidence."
candycrush,au,1.189.0.2,1,App used to be annoyingly addictive but at least it worked. Now the app crashes and becomes a frozen black screen if you leave it for a minute.
candycrush,au,1.188.0.4,1,I am so happy I have deleted that game no stress over the stupid internet connection and I‚Äôm going to delete this game also. King games are outdated and ridiculous. I would not recommend downloading any king games to anyone.ahh! The joy off no stress!!!!  I hope other people feel the same way. Goodbye
candycrush,au,1.188.0.4,4,When I load up the app I get a gift in a a little box and when I get it it says sorry we will wait until you have internet connection other then that it a good game
candycrush,au,1.188.0.4,5,This game stimulates my sweet tooth.
candycrush,au,1.188.0.4,4,"This app is EPIC, but there are a few too many ads. Overall I would say that this app is perfect in all situations."
candycrush,au,1.188.0.4,5,Candy crush is awesome üòç
candycrush,au,1.188.0.4,2,I do like this game but it keeps freezing - 3 times now - and the only way I can keep playing is to delete and reload and I lose all my bonuses.
candycrush,au,1.188.0.4,1,There seems to be a glitch in the latest update on the iPad as it just does not not open and just gives a black screen.
candycrush,au,1.188.0.4,1,"I made some random in app purchases of coins to buy tools. More often than not a double payment is taken and Apple refuses to refund the duplicate amount. 
The game is enjoyable but don‚Äôt buy any extra coins otherwise you‚Äôll be charged twice."
candycrush,au,1.188.0.4,1,Bad.
candycrush,au,1.188.0.4,1,"Used to be such a great game, it was a good mix of challenging and rewarding. They mustn‚Äôt have been making enough money as it is virtually unplayable now unless you are prepared to spend big money on boosters, which I certainly am not! Such a shame."
candycrush,au,1.188.0.4,5,My mum like this game but when I tell her to do the dishes (because she‚Äôs a woman) she hits me. I‚Äôm not sure if this is about the game or if I‚Äôm just mean but apart from this it‚Äôs probably my mums favourite game so 10/10
candycrush,au,1.188.0.4,1,"After playing this game on and off for almost 10 years, the app no longer loads properly where it doesn‚Äôt allow me to sign in and I have now lost all of my levels.
Fix your errors properly and allow players to retrieve their levels."
candycrush,au,1.188.0.4,3,"I love this game it‚Äôs my go too. Except the last week nothing is loading. I can still play levels etc, but my free daily spin, win more moves etc, and my king profile account won‚Äôt load. Is anyone else having this problem??????"
candycrush,au,1.187.1.1,3,Change for change sake. This recent update layout looks like the work experience kid did it. Unnecessary. Does not add any value.
candycrush,au,1.187.1.1,1,Some levels can not pass without buying and spend your money I have spent more then $1500 dollars on this game before you could  go to easy levels and accumulate some prices but they took that away so if you want to pass the higher levels you have no choice but to buy and spend more money  not cool they give nothing back just take and take
candycrush,au,1.186.0.3,3,"I just updated the app and wish I hadn‚Äôt because now if you are on a winning streak and you lose, you just go straight back to having nothing. 
The fact you didn‚Äôt go straight back to zero was always the thing I liked about this game over other similar games. 
Boo hiss boo."
candycrush,au,1.186.0.3,5,Playing for the last seven years.. but really upset with the thing that you use to get extra moves after 48 hours ? Why that has disappeared?? So annoying that was so useful.. please bring it backüôèüèºüôèüèº
candycrush,au,1.186.0.3,1,"Got up to level 4641, and was enjoying these higher levels until this one.

Supposed to get cherries to drop to win but they just don‚Äôt drop even if the whole board is cleared. Not wasting my time any more, deleting the game"
candycrush,au,1.186.0.3,5,This game is very addictive and exciting. I love how it challenges your critical thinking and makes you think about your moves and choices.
candycrush,au,1.186.0.3,4,I‚Äôm signed into my Facebook but if I ask for lives or want to sent it tells me to sign in again to Facebook but that‚Äôs not possible started only a few days ago
candycrush,au,1.186.0.3,5,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME. I AM SO ADDICTED
candycrush,au,1.186.0.3,4,I love the game but I‚Äôve noticed with my recent purchase I was charged twice and only received value for a single purchase - I‚Äôm concerned and hoping this hasn‚Äôt happened previously - I hope this can be rectified.
candycrush,au,1.186.0.3,5,Won‚Äôt work today. Keeps turning off before the game  appears.
candycrush,au,1.186.0.3,1,The game was fun until they removed features from mine like  ‚Äúwin moves free spin‚Äù at the end of a level or ‚Äúwin a booster at the start‚Äù after 7 years of playing.  All just ploy to make money
candycrush,au,1.186.0.3,1,"I have been with this game 8 years, but from June 2020 untill now,   They change many things. They seem want more and more money."
candycrush,au,1.186.0.3,1,This game make me stress and sick ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
candycrush,au,1.186.0.3,1,"I‚Äôm almost over your stupid game. I too have been playing for more years than I care to remember. The game has been gradually gearing towards the fact that you HAVE to purchase boosters or gold bars because it‚Äôs impossible to play any more. Level 7210 is where I STOP! You had a great puzzling game that I enjoyed. I am not enjoying the challenge any more. You have taken away the ability to earn extra moves, you have made it harder in ‚Äòfantastic 5, you have made earning boosters from Chocolate Box so very difficult plus adding the time constraint"
candycrush,au,1.186.0.3,5,So much Candy and not one gram of weight adding onto my body. üòÇ
candycrush,au,1.186.0.3,1,I just had enough of this game and it is so annoying I just got to hate this game or app. Sorry to say this
candycrush,au,1.186.0.3,3,I am a little disappointed to find that after you lose a life there used to be a spin will for extra help on candies now it‚Äôs gone I‚Äôm not happy on that it‚Äôs disappeared
candycrush,au,1.185.0.1,2,How do u get your friends back on this game frm face book! I keep on playing this game but i get ramdon people playing on with me it isnt  all the people frm face book at all! I am to scared to deleted the app otherwise i might loses my game & they might make me start again frm the start! Which i dont want to al all!
candycrush,au,1.185.0.1,1,Just deleted. The game is impossible around the 1400's. It's all just about ads and pop ups and buying boosters and showing that what was once a fun free game is just now you being money grubbing bastards.
candycrush,au,1.185.0.1,3,"Been playing this for years. Had some great stuff like free spin every 48 hours, more points given in the Fantastic 5 event and the game where we could complete 4 challenges and get a lollipop daily.....it has all either been reduced or taken away, which gives me less incentive to play!! Good thing is it‚Äôs saving me money. Shot yourself in the foot CC!!"
candycrush,au,1.185.0.1,1,"I‚Äôve been playing this game for a solid year, always been a favourite. I‚Äôm now on level 2629. They they took away free play on moves (to watch an advert for) now they‚Äôve taken away the chance to win things for completing challenges, plus more. I‚Äôve spent money on this game when I‚Äôve had nothing better to do (sitting in isolation etc) and the more I spent the more things they take away every single time. I‚Äôll never spend a dime on this game again. Not to mention every time I did buy something like freckles/lives etc it was guaranteed I‚Äôd lose as soon as I did that. Oh and I only get the climb the stupid bean stock every time I ran out of lives. But when you don‚Äôt play for a while you‚Äôll win 5 in a row. Stupid game built on strategic money making. There‚Äôs nothing strategic about it though, almost like pokies tactic"

candycrush,au,1.184.1.2,4,The last update saw the developer remove the chance to win turns every 48 hours. Very disappointing. Change it back please.
candycrush,au,1.184.1.2,5,Enjoy the game
candycrush,au,1.184.1.2,5,My spare time as a mum is now so fun as I just sit on the couch and play sugar rush all day long!
candycrush,au,1.184.1.2,3,"Twice now the game loses my login details and cannot login. I have to uninstall the app and load it again to successfully login, but my prizes and entitlements are lost. It seems to have some issue with my Facebook and fails. Very irritating and disappointing. Regards Jennifer."
candycrush,au,1.184.1.2,5,"Sooo fun I love this app great job

- Manuel"
candycrush,au,1.184.1.2,1,"Loved the game and explosiveness of moves, but the recent update makes it seem like explosions and crushing candy to be very smooth and silent. Not a fan, please bring back the old effects"
candycrush,au,1.184.1.2,1,"Game does start ever since the most recent iPad and candy updates. Completed nearly 4000 levels, will not start again.

Any suggestions to fix?"
candycrush,au,1.184.1.2,1,"Well candy crush, today after over 2500 levels I am uninstalling you for good. It was one thing to take away my free chance to play on every 48hrs but now taking away any candys I earn towards my chocolate box unless I win the level!!! Nope that‚Äôs too far. I have spent a lot of money on this game and enjoyed playing but you have taken away every single perk that isn‚Äôt paid for. Farewell you stingy crooks."
candycrush,au,1.184.1.2,3,Good strategy game but it completely lost a whole heap of boosters I had saved up for use in harder levels which is super frustrating.
candycrush,au,1.184.1.2,4,"I can not see the point in time rewards when we waste the time watching 30 second ads.  The irony is, of course, wasting time playing the game but the constant repeated ads do my head in.   Enough!!!!    When something is shoved down my throat this way, it is not the way to sell anything, complete opposite actually."
candycrush,au,1.183.0.3,1,"I‚Äôve been playing this for years and as time progresses the more and more the owners are getting more money greedy and are changing things about their game for their profit. Golden bars are what you use to buy free lives or to buy ‚Äúcheats‚Äù. You get golden bars by paying for them or winning them. You use to be able to buy them much cheaper (and the price seems to keep going up), and win them (through successfully completing a level). It is seeming to get harder and harder to win golden bars. In addition, now the owners of the game have taken away the free spin function at the end of a lost game, which would give you a second chance at the lost game (to try and win gold bars quicker), or would win you cheats. Now that‚Äôs gone. It‚Äôs obvious they keep making changes to make more money and it‚Äôs really starting to make me hate playing. It‚Äôs just greedy, as if they don‚Äôt make enough money off people as is. I refuse to buy bars anymore because they are way over priced and you don‚Äôt get much for what pay for anymore anyways. Really going down hill candy crush, and you‚Äôre about to lose loyal customers because of your greedy antics!"
candycrush,au,1.183.0.3,5,Good to relax but nothing else just good to relax
candycrush,au,1.183.0.3,5,ADDICTIVE AS HECK!!!
candycrush,au,1.183.0.3,3,How do I play this has never happened before
candycrush,au,1.183.0.3,2,What have you done with a chance at free moves at the end  of levels you are stuck on. You are making this game to hard and  I‚Äôm loosing interest in playing. You are taking away the ability to win any bonuses anymore. Very dissspointed.
candycrush,au,1.183.0.3,2,Stop changing the number of moves available and making it harder thanks
candycrush,au,1.183.0.3,4,Why did you get rid of the weekly race and ability to play on with the spinning wheel? I enjoyed trying to beat my friends every week.
candycrush,au,1.183.0.3,5,"I love this game, go ahead and download it!
First my mom got it, then dad,brother and then me! It is so fun! I love it! I am speechless on what this game can do!"
candycrush,au,1.183.0.3,1,"Just takes so long to move between levels, pop-up after pop-up...."
candycrush,au,1.183.0.3,2,"It used to be fun!
You could spend an hour climbing up to nowhere, but now they give you no chance at your first 15-20 attempts in most maps so that you spend your money. After, if you are still struggling, it starts to make you win in an obvious way."
candycrush,au,1.183.0.3,2,"Newest update made this game really slow to play
Multiple screens now pop up 
You can‚Äôt just replay a level without getting 4 pop ups before hand"
candycrush,au,1.183.0.3,5,Great fun when I am winning
candycrush,au,1.182.0.3,5,Awesome game but I‚Äôm up to level 2156 and now it is really hard
candycrush,au,1.182.0.3,5,My mother loves this game
candycrush,au,1.182.0.3,5,Been keeping me busy for years
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,5,Sweetest game ever.
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,3,Bring back candy track. Bring back win moves. Stop removing things and adding things that aren‚Äôt as good or replacing with nothing at all.
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,5,will play for a long time during the lockdown at home
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,2,Too many extras now. This is becoming slow to load and play.
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,3,So annoying .. the level I am vey often the onion and cherries just don‚Äôt appear!!!
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,3,"So I‚Äôve spent a lot of money on your game cause I love playing and it‚Äôs all good however, when I spent money for the boosters and you put them in spots I can‚Äôt use then they get turned to cement, so god damn annoying"
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,5,I love it!
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,1,"Literally puts levels in that you cannot win without spending money, example level 73 it said over 5.5 million people needed to use power ups just a money grab rng based game like slot machines, gives you a few easy wins to try and suck you in once the ‚Äúbad‚Äù luck starts."
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,4,This is my favourite game for sure. Except every time I get close to passing a level lately it shuts my phone down. Pls take a look at this. Thanks
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,1,Certain effects in this game are very dangerous for seizure disorders and there is NO WARNING and no way to disable these effects.
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,5,Great game but can we have a function where we can send boosters and gold to friends to help out with difficult levels?
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,5,"very challenging & fun game, defs recommend u too download it if u don‚Äôt have it already, trust me u won‚Äôt regret it!"
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,1,"Candy crush is a terrible game and I would not recommend it to anyone. You get stuck on a certain level. The first couple of rounds is ok, but after a while it‚Äôs nearly impossible! The games are always the same, and you end up thinking you are repeating the same level! And now the ad. I saw an add about it! That got me thinking that I was right about thinking this was a bad game. I hope you believe what I think and maybe you won‚Äôt like it anymore now you read this."
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,5,"Candy crush is the best game I‚Äôve ever played! It is great fun too!
It HAS to be the best rated game in the world! Yay!"
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,1,"Some are far too hard 
Too many bombs coming at you all the time
Very repetitive"
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,2,üò≠night good makes me feel abt to cry
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,5,Fully addicted to this game.......Been playing this game for years now and still love it except for I have noticed a few changes! One being where you could buy 15 gold bars now it‚Äôs only 10 and not sure if it‚Äôs a bug but you‚Äôve also removed the option to win a move at the end of the game
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,1,"I used to love candy crush and I would occasionally buy bonus packs to help finish off a game I was stuck on.  I‚Äôve noticed again that king has increased prices and reduced the number of gold bars you buy, for example piggy bank, used to get 60 bars for $5, now you get 30 bars for the same price. 

King has become too greedy and I will no longer play nor recommend this game. They‚Äôve even removed the free spin at the end of the game now which would sometimes give bonus moves. Poor form greedy king."
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,1,So as you saw this game is juz nah k. So make the game into a dentistry game that would be quite fabulous
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,2,Latest updates have removed benefits given to get through hard sets so couldn‚Äôt be bothered and moving on after years of playing and paying. Why remove daily spin after years?  Also swapping the freckles for a stripe when passing a set and then resetting when a life is lost? Used to be fun but too frustrating now without enjoyment.
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,3,"I have been playing for many years. Since you‚Äôve taken away the free spin after 48 hours for the chance to win 5 extra moves or boosters, the game has become too challenging. I‚Äôm only passing a level a week, if that. I‚Äôm rapidly losing interest!"
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,3,I have spent many hours playing the game (level +5000) but recently updates have taken away things like chances to win 5 extra moves every 48 hours. Also getting out of the level without making a move you lose a life which never happened before. Losing interest in the game as they try and change it more
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,5,"I definitely recommend candy crush for people who get bored easily and are impatient because it is fun and yeah that‚Äôs really all I have to say. It‚Äôs just an extremely good game and I think everyone should be able to download it and play it.

Regards,
Savannah"
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,1,"Interesting that you don‚Äôt post all of the reviews. Anyway, I‚Äôve noticed that there are no free spins anymore and that some of the games are just not very fun it interesting to play anymore. I expect it to be harder at the level I‚Äôm on, but I did note that it takes a lot longer to get through the levels now. It would be good if you could have the jam spreader games every now and again"
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,3,"I‚Äôve been playing candy crush for an extremely long time. Some of levels are quite challenging and sometimes you just need a little extra somethin‚Äô to get you over the line. When this would happen, I would always watch a couple adds and get what I needed. Taking this option out has made the game less enjoyable. Fix ittttt pleaseeee"
candycrush,au,1.180.0.1,5,It‚Äôs is so GOOD
candycrush,au,1.179.0.3,1,"You‚Äôre basically making the levels harder and removing all the ‚Äúfree‚Äù bonuses like there used to be free spin every 48 hours and god knows how much money you want us to spend on this game. Half the time, the bonuses don‚Äôt show up after tg3 money spent and apple wouldn‚Äôt help even with the screen shots saying ‚Äúno money deducted from your bank‚Äù and the app support from king isn‚Äôt any help either."
candycrush,au,1.179.0.3,5,"My auntie plays this game every night and whenever I see her play it I always want to have a go! üç≠
I downloaded it a few months ago and play it almost everyday it‚Äôs very addictive, but very frustrating when you can‚Äôt beat a level and have tried many many times. I am on level 158 and find candy crush very relaxing when your annoyed, stressed or just happy üòÜ 
I‚Äôm like this game because there are NO adds witch in a lot of games have a ton, üç≠üç¨üç´ I absolutely love candy crush and sofa saga and the others please keep updated it. I‚Äôm only 10 but find it fun, relaxing and a great stress reliever. Thank you everyone who works on it and keep up the good work."
candycrush,au,1.179.0.3,2,"It‚Äôs a game of luck not skill, designed to gratify until the games get harder and you start paying for useless boosts that really don‚Äôt help. The more you pay the more the game goes in your favour until you need to pay again. Addictive. Not really when you realise skill is a zero factor and the manipulation of the monetisation element is 100%"
candycrush,au,1.179.0.3,1,"Trying to link it to Facebook keeps saying wifi issue which is not the case
Been using only wifi all night with other games
Turned off wifi used only phone data same issue"
candycrush,au,1.179.0.3,1,You pay to get extra chance and it closes and you don‚Äôt get anything if it happens one more time I‚Äôll delete
candycrush,au,1.179.0.3,5,"Best game ever,great levels and very competitive"
candycrush,au,1.179.0.3,5,It cool üòé yeah when u get to level 10 u get free candy just give the creators your address and then they will give u as much candy as u would possibly want but I don‚Äôt want to because I don‚Äôt want to be fat fat fat chungus no no no. GO PLAY NOW ITS FREE

candycrush,au,1.178.0.3,4,As I‚Äôm loaded as US rather than Aust. Can‚Äôt get access to prizes or purchase opportunities
candycrush,au,1.178.0.3,5,I‚Äôm 70 yrs young and I love this game.
candycrush,au,1.178.0.3,1,No longer enjoyable. The menus are bad. Continued pressure to buy in app purchases. No love for people just wanting to play enjoy the game.
candycrush,au,1.177.1.3,3,"It‚Äôs good way to pass time however, upon downloading candy crush on my iPad and log into my account which sprooks ‚Äòsaving progress‚Äô yada yada the games wont sync up having a 1300 lvl difference.. 

Contacted support and they can only sync them up if i loose all my stars, high scores and any bonuses I have in my backpack .. 

Pretty p-iss poor if you ask me."
candycrush,au,1.177.1.3,5,Candy crush is an amazing game it gets all of your worries to float away into nothingness when your bored you can play this game soon you‚Äôll be excited in now time it‚Äôs great for all ages over the age limit even if your 98 you can enjoy it I personally go straight to candy crush when I can‚Äôt go to sleep you shall definitely download candy crush for the time of your life my nana plays it but she‚Äôs finished all the levels in only up to my 100s I need her to help me sometimes it also keeps you entertained when stuck at home during covid19
candycrush,au,1.177.1.3,5,I love this game it is so fun and addictive keep up the good work
candycrush,au,1.177.1.3,3,"I used to love this game but it suddenly got really hard, what used to be a fun and relaxing game is now stressful and time consuming. Also, I hate the change they made with the chocolate sprinkle ball things, the look weird. I know that isn‚Äôt super important but I just wanted to add that."
candycrush,au,1.177.1.3,2,The stages are quite repetitive. If you cant think of anything new why don't you open the platform to your players. I am sure there are millions who would think of unique stages just to see their name in the game. you could name the stages after them.
candycrush,au,1.177.1.3,4,"Well this game is awesome and super addictive but the basically when I started I didn‚Äôt get any gold bars and the only way to get them was to pay and I didn‚Äôt want to do that. Also wrong with this game you have to go on to a website to customise your character and people don‚Äôt always want to do that like me.

Also on this game it‚Äôs a bit old and didn‚Äôt have all the cool features but that is the cool thing about it this game is super awesome and you should really get it"
candycrush,au,1.176.0.2,5,We need to be able to block people who ask for lives all the time but never return the favour!!!
candycrush,au,1.176.0.2,1,"I loose all the time, the game is too hard!!!"
candycrush,au,1.176.0.2,1,"I am back after a break hoping this app would be better but after a finally winning a few levels, I am on level 5540 it‚Äôs obvious this app has gone backwards. The devs don‚Äôt read these reviews as there is a growing number of players with the same issues with this app.  Sugar drops and candy friends have been removed, build a bot goes to the start after a failed level rather than one step down. Fantastic 5 is 7000 points but was 5000 previously. With every update rather than fixing bugs, the number of turns is reduced and items to remove are increased. Have a look a YouTube for your current level from 12 months ago. The ability to exit a game without removing a life was done to make the game harder and now to pass a hard level unless you want to play the same level 50 times you need multiple power ups but there is very little chance of winning free power ups. Free power ups are a thing of the past no more now. Even the free spin at the end of a failed game now only counts down while you are playing only so good bye as I will be finding a game to play not an app like this one."
candycrush,au,1.176.0.2,2,Good game and all but the purple levels were my favourite and now they are gone.
candycrush,au,1.176.0.2,5,"Great game,Cory it!"
candycrush,au,1.176.0.2,5,"Absolutely brilliant, challenging and exciting."
candycrush,au,1.176.0.2,5,Love the challenge of the super hard levels. Great boredom buster too
candycrush,au,1.176.0.2,1,"After this update, the app crashes immediately and won‚Äôt open"
candycrush,au,1.176.0.2,1,I enjoy swiping and thinking and winning. It pisses me off when I am stuck on a level - not because I don‚Äôt have the experience to progress but the algorithm doesn‚Äôt want me to. Makes the whole game pointless.
candycrush,au,1.175.0.4,1,"I got a new iPad and when I loaded my saved account all my boosters - over 550 of them- were gone. Also gone were all my gold bars. 
On emailing them I got a reply from a BOT telling me that that is what happens. 
Why do you make it like that???!!

Also good customer relations does not occur when your only reply is from a Bot. It makes us angrier.

I later got an email that 50 gold bars were waiting for me in a different game - I don‚Äôt want to play another game.  What a stupid response.

Why not return my gold bars to Candy Crush Saga and gift me ( if you can‚Äôt return) several hundred boosters?
That would be fair."
candycrush,au,1.175.0.4,5,My mum loves this game she's been playing it for 9 years!
candycrush,au,1.175.0.4,3,New May update won‚Äôt even open.
candycrush,au,1.175.0.4,3,I don‚Äôt understand the game really. Needs better explanation of how it works
candycrush,au,1.175.0.4,1,"I‚Äôm another long term player (level 4684) who is irritated re changes made. Less moves now available on levels (based on what i saw on youtube videos - eg 18 v 24). 
And now the fact that you can not pick up boosters from previous levels makes this game nothing more than a game you need to keep playing and playing and either spend money or keep playing til you get a board setup in a way that‚Äôs solvable. Because on some levels boards ate setup with these limited moves that makes the board unsolvable - TLDR: nasty rip off with no ethics!!!"
candycrush,au,1.175.0.4,5,"I have spent many hours playing this game and I find it very relaxing. Thank you for extending lives and giving 24 hr periods to play in this COVID period. 

Very thoughtful and appreciated."
candycrush,au,1.175.0.4,1,Only way to get past certain levels is to pay your way. Silly levels that only work when your trying to get anyone to make a purchase! Absolutely joke!
candycrush,au,1.175.0.4,1,Garbage.
candycrush,au,1.175.0.4,1,"I dumped this once again, because you keep moving the goalposts. You promise and deliver nothing."
candycrush,au,1.175.0.4,1,Every time I watch an add to get a bonus or something the add for this game pops up and my whole device shuts down and doesn‚Äôt turn back on for another 3 hours and it deletes all my data overall the game is good just stop putting out adds.
candycrush,au,1.175.0.4,1,"While I enjoy playing Candy Crush, having fewer moves to complete levels is ridiculous. I have been on level 2551 with only 28 moves for about 1 month now and it is getting very frustrating. Every time I make a move one of my candies is blocked quicker than I can move it. I know that sometimes dumb luck will win but this is a joke. I‚Äôve had extremely difficult levels that I have cleared in one go. I know why the moves have been reduced, but I would rather use my boosters, which by the way aren‚Äôt much of a help. I will persevere but only for so long."
candycrush,au,1.175.0.4,1,Bring back the ability to exit a level without losing a life and the extra booster wheel that we could use after failing a level. Not everyone has the money to constantly make purchases. I am so sick of the stupid changes you keep making.
candycrush,au,1.174.0.2,3,"Being playing for years (level 5000 something) - recent updates are frustrating there has always been inconsistencies amongst my fiends with different benefits and rewards when playing same levels but now it‚Äôs ridiculous - game keeps changing bonuses, removes candies, gives rewards to random players, unable to give friends lives, profile not recognized etc It is taking away from the joy of the game. Get your sugar together Candy Crush...you‚Äôre better than this!!!"
candycrush,au,1.174.0.2,1,Please fix up my profile. I am not a stupid rabbit.
candycrush,au,1.174.0.2,1,Why would u add diamond STAR. It ruined the GAME
candycrush,au,1.174.0.2,5,Somewhat challenging love it
candycrush,au,1.174.0.2,1,"AI sets the board up right when you have no lives left giving a promising setup to pass a hard level, purely to entice people into making purchases. Nothing random in this game at all, cleverly programmed to make you spend."
candycrush,au,1.174.0.2,1,Change your ads I was playing Merge TD and your goddamn ad came up and I couldn‚Äôt do anything except get hyperlinked to your game CHANGE YOUR ADS also seriously another candy crush theres Candy crush saga Candy king etc.
candycrush,au,1.174.0.2,3,I love the game but unfortunately due to recent updates I am no longer able to play on my IPad!!!
candycrush,au,1.174.0.2,5,It‚Äôs so cool that we get so many power ups and money I‚Äôm already on level 2012 and I‚Äôve only had the game for a year
candycrush,au,1.174.0.2,5,I stopped collecting sugar drops. Can you please add these back into candy crush. A lot of the changes you have made I don‚Äôt like. Please change it back to normal.
candycrush,au,1.174.0.2,5,Bestest
candycrush,au,1.174.0.2,1,"I used to love playing all the candy crush sagas, however I have lost ALL of levels because stupid candy crush has asked me to save my profile 
WHAT A WASTE

Now I have to start from scratch, do you know how long it has taken me to get to the levels I was on, to loose all of them

How do I get my levels back? Or is it a waste asking????

Disappointed"
candycrush,au,1.174.0.2,5,"As it‚Äôs lockdown in my country; it has been a great source of entertainment to me. 

Thank you"
candycrush,au,1.174.0.2,2,Fun game and it gets pretty dang hard ever 10 levels prepare your minds üòÉüòÇ
candycrush,au,1.174.0.2,1,"Every time I purchase something you take out 3 x that from my account. For example my last $2.99 purchase, you took $2.99 then $4.49 at the same time. This has happened each time I have purchases anything."
candycrush,au,1.174.0.2,5,Excellent game
candycrush,au,1.174.0.2,5,Love the game. Keeps me amused.
candycrush,au,1.173.1.1,1,Unimpressed. All they want is you to pay money so you can move on to the next level!! I‚Äôm on 1721 and have been for weeks. Have refused to buy any boosters and still on same level. Time to delete the app!!!!!
candycrush,au,1.173.1.1,5,Another addition to my collections of addictions
candycrush,au,1.173.1.1,5,It‚Äôs one of my favourite games in the world. So many challenges and fun levels to play. It‚Äôs an awesome game to play when you are stressed or being lazy in bed! I highly recommend this game. ü§ìCandy Crush is addictive! ‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíõüíöüíôüíú
candycrush,au,1.173.1.1,5,wonderful game‚ù§Ô∏èüòç
candycrush,au,1.173.1.1,5,Just wanted to say thanks guys for unlimited lives while we are all going through crazy times hope everyone stays safe.
candycrush,au,1.173.0.2,5,Thank you candy crush for looking after us during the lock-down; continual lives!
candycrush,au,1.173.0.2,5,"Hey guys how about some free bars to help us out while stuck in the house with nothing to do!!

Edit: Wow thank you!!"
candycrush,au,1.173.0.2,5,"So much fun ,I got addicted to this not long ago , sometimes I sit there for hours playing ,it really recommend it 10/10"
candycrush,au,1.173.0.2,1,"The game is far to reliant on randomness, and as such some levels are impossible to beat without using boosters, forcing you to buy them or endlessly grind previous levels to try to win them."
candycrush,au,1.173.0.2,1,It gets boring losing every time...
candycrush,au,1.173.0.2,5,Hi
candycrush,au,1.173.0.2,4,"Level 2874 - playing for enjoyment has taken another turn. What was an enjoyable game has now turned me off. Ridiculously hard if you have no additional help icons. Paying money, not going to happen. Everyone likes a little challenge but this is absolutely ridiculous"
candycrush,au,1.172.0.1,5,Love this game
candycrush,au,1.172.0.1,1,"Thanks for deleting all my progress and boosters while I was playing, and for automatically making me repeat a level instead taking to the next one. AND then for having no user support whatsoever to report the problems. Useless p**cks."
candycrush,au,1.172.0.1,4,Love it
candycrush,au,1.172.0.1,5,I never get tired playing this.
candycrush,au,1.172.0.1,1,Just deleted the game after trying to do level 889. Getting 15 wrapped candies with the corners and centre blocked and only 13 moves is virtually impossible and definitely not enjoyable. The only way would be lucky enough to get a candy bomb and a wrapped candy together. The odds on that happening on that board are slim to nil.
candycrush,au,1.172.0.1,1,"After a recent update I‚Äôm not able to collect 180 candies every 8 hours to get some boosters. Other players on the same level can, so the app discriminates people. Some other features are available for one group of players and not available for others. Without help of boosters it‚Äôs almost impossible to play. Even rewarded ads almost disappeared, so I can‚Äôt watch videos to get the boosters. I‚Äôm considering to delete the game if they don‚Äôt fix it. I‚Äôm not going to spend hours on a single level only because boosters are not available. Some levels are so hard so no way to pass them without boosters. What was the point to remove them if you lose customers and lose revenue from not watching/clicking rewarded videos??? Fix it!"
candycrush,au,1.172.0.1,5,Candy crush rules I play it all night
candycrush,au,1.171.0.1,4,Hi fellow candy crushers I am proud to say candy crush is in my top ten favourite game!
candycrush,au,1.171.0.1,5,"I‚Äôm unable to collect my boosts. Can you please fix this problem as it‚Äôs been going on for over a month now.
Thank you"
candycrush,au,1.171.0.1,3,"Bring back the C‚Äôs,  they disappeared a few days ago.  It‚Äôs a great way to collect prizes.  I won‚Äôt be spending any money on this app regardless."
candycrush,au,1.171.0.1,2,I paid for 60 bars ($4.49) and it said error occurred but took money out of my account anyway. Not happy.
candycrush,au,1.171.0.1,5,I really enjoy it üëç
candycrush,au,1.171.0.1,1,"Great game. Found it fun until.... i got a new phone. Tried to transfer my progress - epically failed. Tried the support centre - no help there. Tried reinstalling and deleting app to see if that would fix things - nup. Sent an email, the reply was to go to the Help Centre which was useless. Requested them to reinstate my sweet supplies, gold bars and all ofher stuff. Oh no! Guess what the reply was? Yep go to the Help Centre and try reading one of their ‚Äòhelpful articles‚Äô. ARE YOU KIDDING??!!! Oh and they never did reinstae my stuff. 

All this on top of making me link my account to my FB page which i didnt want and didnt have to do when I initially loaded the game. Candy Crush, our relationship is over. YOU ARE DUMPED!!!"
candycrush,au,1.171.0.1,1,What s happened to the candies?? Nothing seems to work properly
candycrush,au,1.171.0.1,5,This is a really good game the more points you get you can move up
candycrush,au,1.171.0.1,3,"Loved this game, until now.  Stuck on level 384, have tried to fathom out what to do at least 50 times. Very frustrating, lost patience now."
candycrush,au,1.171.0.1,5,"to whom it may concern
Very disappointed..been on level 700 or 800 +. 
I get locked out and the game begins from level 1 again. Can you please install me back to my level thank you

candycrush,au,1.170.0.2,1,"Am stuck on 1274. I would happily buy help, as I have loads of times before. But I don‚Äôt think anything could help. Cannot move on.  You say relax and play,   I am just getting frustrated and starting to hate the game. Almost time to say goodbye. Even though we like a challenge, I don‚Äôt need an impossible level just so you can make more money."

candycrush,au,1.170.0.2,1,"Passed level 1213, been stuck on it for ages. Finally passed it using 3 power ups and then it said I haven‚Äôt passed it had to do it again. The game is rigged. Stupid game"
candycrush,au,1.170.0.2,1,Candy crush is good but too annoying. I only started a month ago and I hate when the ‚Äúexplosions ‚Äú go of and I can‚Äôt do anything. Deleted this game already.
candycrush,au,1.170.0.2,5,Loving the new upgrade where you have the option to watch ads for an extra life or a booster. Brilliant! Thank you. This is perfect for addicts like me that can‚Äôt get enough of this game üòä
candycrush,au,1.170.0.2,5,Love testing my brain and strategic play
candycrush,au,1.170.0.2,1,"We all know the game is rigged and it has always been acceptable to a certain level but after the latest changes the game has become ridiculous with how stingy they have become with rewards and the possibility of at least feeling you have a chance of winning without spending too much money. 

I have to thank King because they have cured me of the last of the Candy Crush addictions. Already deleted all the other ones and now deleting this one."
candycrush,au,1.169.1.1,1,Having big issues can‚Äôt connect to the kingdom even with internet connection. Also won‚Äôt connect to Facebook so I can‚Äôt receive gifts or to spin the wheel for free items üò§üòæ
candycrush,au,1.169.1.1,2,"A recent change means that you can‚Äôt reset the board without losing a life. Makes the game a lot harder, and some levels now take ages to complete unless gold bars and/or boosters are purchased, something I generally refuse to do. This means that I find the game much less fun. I‚Äôm in the high 3000s and think it‚Äôs time to stop playing"
candycrush,au,1.169.1.1,1,I‚Äôve just purchased a new iPhone... and I‚Äôve lost my scores on candy crush. I was up to level 1811 üò© please help. #candycrushaddict

candycrush,au,1.169.1.1,5,Awesome
candycrush,au,1.169.1.1,3,Although I love the game have found over last few months that sometimes the daily reward does not appear even though you‚Äôve accepted it.  Most annoying
candycrush,au,1.169.1.1,1,I signed up to Facebook to save my progress and all my gold bars and Lollies were taken off me. But I was still in level 237. Was not happy. Why did this happen
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,2,"It‚Äôs like someone changed the program to be a bit nasty. Also, the company has succumbed to the lure of longer adds, so if you don‚Äôt watch, you won‚Äôt get any extras.
Less people playing."
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,5,Could u update quickly? Thanks
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,5,"Love this game. But hate it when you can't continue coz of having to buy extra moves or candy to finish a level. If you want to get more lives but don't want to pay for it, (iPhone Users only) turn your automatic date and time off, fast forward till tomorrow, then go back to automatic date and time, you will have a full 5 lives again."
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,3,When I connect to game I am not getting my icon. I get ‚Äú onion head ‚Äú instead. This allows me to play but not send or receive lives from my actual friends. This seems to be happening on a regular pattern. This time it started yesterday evening.
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,5,Enjoyable
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,4,I‚Äôm da bomb just like da game
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,3,"This would be 5 stars but when the game keeps trying to suggest options of matches to me it INFURIATES MEEEE
I want to try and use my brain but it doesnt even give me time to think :/"
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,3,Having problems with playing game today can‚Äôt find level I‚Äôm up to keep scrolling down can‚Äôt find it is this a glitch since the update
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,5,There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this game and I cannot stop playing this I recommend getting this game.also the graphics are excellent
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,4,"This game is so addictive.
I am literally on level 3743.
I play it like everyday.
I had depression 2 years back and I attempted suicide but this game kept me going. It was the only thing I looked forward to everyday. Thank you!"
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,3,I want to have more cash and make friends that you can chat with I hope you change the game
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,2,the game is fun but it would help if the game wasn‚Äôt so assistive  because half of the time I spend playing this game is just me waiting to be able to move without being given the answer
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,5,Challenging and entertaining
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,5,After the bonuses :)
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,5,"This game is the best! I would recommend Candy Crush Saga to you guys looking for a relaxed, nice and peaceful game where you can win prizes and go up levels! You can also play Episode Races and win gold bars! (By the way, in-game gold bars have to be purchased, but you can win them for free!!! üòÅü•≥). You also get at the start of the game, FREE 50 GOLD!! So download this game and HAVE FUN WITH IT!A"
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,3,So levels can start way to easy (mainly due to the free boosts) until you reach a actually hard level (was able to reach level 200 in a couple of days with only a handful of levels that took more than 2 tries). Also game freezes in the middle of some levels and there‚Äôs nothing you can do other than take the loss. Please work on more consistent difficulty levels for at least the beginning of the game...
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,1,"This game is addictive and I do like it, however I must say the 30sec ads it tries to force on you are torture. Any company that is doing 30sec ads I will be avoiding. I don‚Äôt mind watching ads for bonuses but you need to make them less than 15secs. It ruins the game."
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,5,Fun
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,3,Love the game but it‚Äôs just not fair how it‚Äôs consistently requires funds to continue to play üòû
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,5,It‚Äôs fun especially when you win & pass the levels
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,5,Awesome game I love it so very hard to stop playing it
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,3,I love playing Candy Crush but annoyed that the bonus candies you collect on each level to win prizes is capped at 5 now üòí
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,5,I think you could fix it by making a world race where you could see who can go the furthest. And. Also you could make it a little more harder! But other then that its great!üòÑ
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,5,"Love candy crush,it challenging,fun and awesome games"
candycrush,au,1.168.0.3,1,"Every day I‚Äôve been doing Candy Drop to gain more boosters.  Now I can only get FIVE Candy Drops per level!  That means I now have to play 36 levels. 36!  To gain the 180 Candy Drops. 

This is absurd. 

I‚Äôve only just started getting decent boosters that are untimed. Thank goodness. 

And now this!"
candycrush,au,1.167.0.2,5,Awesome
candycrush,au,1.167.0.2,5,Be warned..... this game is highly addictive but so much fun.
candycrush,au,1.167.0.2,1,I just paid $2.99 so I could play on because I am sick of this level and it didn‚Äôt let me play on. I want my money back.
candycrush,au,1.167.0.2,4,I used to love playing this game but now everytime I exit a game I lose a life. I thought you would fix it but clearly not. I‚Äôm not going to play while this occurs and I‚Äôm sure many others feel the same way.
candycrush,au,1.167.0.2,1,Game keeps crashing. Won't even open.  Are you working on it.
candycrush,au,1.167.0.2,3,"Very fun but an update in december made it less fun. No more new board if you get out, unless you want to lose a life. Also it does not connect anymore to the internet and if I try to log in it say try again soon and no log in. Today‚Äôs update did not fix the problem."
candycrush,au,1.167.0.2,5,Enjoying a lot feel fresh and stress busterüòäüòäüòä
candycrush,au,1.166.0.4,1,"Received an email wanting payment for $90+ for Christmas Sweeper 3 packs that I didn‚Äôt authorise. Initially fooled me because I had used two Christmas sweepers around the date specified. There was a link on the invoice to report a problem that wanted all my details. I took the invoice to the Apple Store who identified it as a scam, that could see what gamers on Candy Crush are doing. BEWARE!!!!!"
candycrush,au,1.166.0.4,3,"I‚Äôve been playing candy crush for well over a year now and have always had those extra videos (ads) that you can watch to receive a booster or extra turns. Then I suddenly lost these with the last update. 

Would really like them back on because it just makes the game frustrating."
candycrush,au,1.166.0.4,1,"I loath the nerve racking move suggestions!!
I want to decide the moves. What‚Äôs the point of playing otherwise??
I want to take my time to choose what moves to make without this constant flashing!!
How do I turn it off?"
candycrush,au,1.166.0.4,4,This is an awesome game but can we bring back the teeth please they were way better than the UFO. Please!
candycrush,au,1.166.0.4,4,"Would otherwise have given it five stars but gave it four. Three times recently I paid for 10 gold bars to continue my game and the app took my money but then I wasn‚Äôt able to continue, plus the gold bars were not in my stash. Otherwise I have really enjoyed candy crush. Especially in my downtime when I just feel like zoning out and relaxing."
candycrush,au,1.166.0.4,5,A great game to play when relaxing
candycrush,au,1.166.0.4,2,I totally agree with Goldenmonkey24 about the latest change King have made to CandyCrush Saga. I too have spent a lot of money to keep getting through the latest levels and made a big effort to collect boosters to help me along. Then you change them to timed ones  which are useless to me. I put up with baby playing morn8ng and night to get the few that I can save for when I need them. Then you take away my ability to restart a game to give me a better starting position so I can get through it. Not fair to take away a booster and a life just because I want to reset it. Now I am about to delete the game and never play again.  I‚Äôve wasted enough money and time. It‚Äôs not fun anymore. It seems the better I get at it you make it deliberately harder and harder to make me spend more money.
candycrush,au,1.166.0.4,5,"They take your money, ignore your emails, pretend to care, do nothing and close the case saying you didn‚Äôt reply, except I replied 5 times, gave them proof of purchase 5 times, nothing, crickets, still waiting but they closed the case. No wonder they earn $64,000,000 a day ..."
candycrush,au,1.166.0.4,4,"Why don‚Äôt we get a coconut wheel booster when we‚Äôre playing mixed levels? If the level consists of ingredients, shouldn‚Äôt a coconut wheel be an available booster??"
candycrush,au,1.166.0.4,5,Very nice and fresh game
candycrush,au,1.166.0.4,2,When I changed my mind about a level I lose a life and my boosters. Annoying.
candycrush,au,1.166.0.4,4,Great game! One issue though is during play on iPhone 8 iOS 13.3 if you leave to look at another app then come back the sound is off.
candycrush,au,1.166.0.4,5,"1st this app rocks and I got 2 lols for you! Lol 1: When I was tying to get off lvl 74 I kept having to use lollipops 15x more goes
Etc. then finally I got out and i said phew! Lol 2: Even know i play 
Candy crush more Then my mum... SHE IS STILL LIKE 100 MORE 
LEVELS THAN ME SO WEIRD. 
Its amazing when ur bored on ur device and there‚Äôs nothing u can think to play BOOM! Just play candy crush! Also How Many Lvls Are There?"
candycrush,au,1.166.0.4,5,I love candy crush it‚Äôs so addictive it‚Äôs fun to play everyday right now I‚Äôm on level 34 I started yesterday morning I have been playing for Ages!üëåüòÄüòÄ
candycrush,au,1.166.0.4,1,"Been playing since it first came out 5400 levels later... the latest update which wont allow you to rested the board without loosing a life has put me off, no point buying boosters if I can maximise their value. Bye"
candycrush,au,1.166.0.4,5,This is an excellent game 100/10 I love it üòª
candycrush,au,1.166.0.4,4,"My candy crush saga game has just stopped. I can see what boosters I have etc but I can‚Äôt load the next game. I‚Äôm up in the 2000‚Äôs for my level so don‚Äôt want to re install the app.
I‚Äôve deleted storage and updated the app and my phone and re started my phone several times . It‚Äôs been days. How can I fix it?"
candycrush,au,1.166.0.4,3,Exactly like what GoldenMonkey24 wrote for his review... it‚Äôs painfully slow when you won‚Äôt let us reset the board without costing a life & all the boosters! Put it back to the way it was please... thank you.
candycrush,au,1.165.2,1,Previously loved this game... in fact was on level 5978. Downloaded the new update and all my previous hard work is gone!! Definitely not going to play any King games in the future
candycrush,au,1.165.2,1,"Game won‚Äôt connect to the internet when I have my iPad connected to wifi, please fix this bug NOW! üò†üò°"
candycrush,au,1.165.2,1,"Using strategy and your brain by not committing to a level - sorry, that‚Äôs just not on!!!

Let‚Äôs take that away from you so in your frustration you need to spend money to progress at the same rate!!!

Thanks for the wonderful years but sometimes relationships have to end - in this case due to your greediness.

Deleted the app this morning."
candycrush,au,1.165.2,5,"Candy Crush is great, the challenges and graphics just keep getting better! ü§óü§óü§ó"
candycrush,au,1.165.2,3,"No longer able to exit a board before playing without losing a life. If I move from one device to another and it‚Äôs not in sync then I have to either play the level again or exit and lose a life. 

Let‚Äôs cancel King by not making purchases till the feature comes back"
candycrush,au,1.165.2,1,Give the option where we can exit the level without loosing a life back ! Seriously thinking about deleting the game have been playing for years !!
candycrush,au,1.165.2,1,Now that you can‚Äôt exit when you go into an incorrect level without losing a life is not fair
candycrush,au,1.165.2,2,As a avid player of Candy Crush I don‚Äôt like the new update as the envelope that has the lives you ask for has moved & is way too small especially for someone who has not the best eyesight.
candycrush,au,1.165.2,1,Please fix this... i was on the 2000+ level and when i downloaded the update it place me back to the very beginning
candycrush,au,1.165.2,2,"I‚Äôve spent several hundreds over the years playing this game getting to the high 4000‚Äôs- I find it relaxing - or I used to until they changed it so that you lose a life when you reset the board. Given that some levels are so difficult that resetting the board until you get your boosters where you want them is absolutely necessary, this is just an unconscionable cash grab. Why not be inventive (like you used to be, King) adding value for players to purchase rather than just removing what you had already given. One of the reasons I‚Äôve never spent anything on Candy Soda (although I still play it) is the inability to reset the board. It makes the game slow and frustrating and is a disincentive to buy extras. Contrast with my spending where you could reset the board, make some progress, feel good about playing, keep playing, keep spending. Get the picture King? I‚Äôve often thought about quitting when things got a bit hard - but kept going - however, unless this issue is fixed I will choose to spend my time (and money) on Bubblemania which still has issues but at least they appear to listen to feedback and fix things that frustrate paying customers."
candycrush,au,1.165.2,5,I‚Äôm lovin it
candycrush,au,1.165.2,1,Hate the last update how you lose a life if you get out of the game without playing it! Just made it more annoying
candycrush,au,1.165.2,2,Love this game but now when I click on a level then decide I don‚Äôt want to play it without making a move I get a life taken and any bonuses with it... if this continues I feel it‚Äôs not worth my time playing this game
candycrush,au,1.165.2,5,Fun game but most levels screw you over
candycrush,au,1.165.2,1,When i want to leave the game i loose a soul even if i don't make any move.. how relaxing.
candycrush,au,1.165.2,1,"I have loved playing Candy Crush since the early days, but this latest update takes away the fun factor, it is now annoying & frustrating. Don‚Äôt accidentally hit the wrong level because if you try to exit you‚Äôll lose a life & your booster selection. I have not written an app review before. I think my Candy crushing days are over, going to delete the app."
candycrush,au,1.165.2,5,C‚Äôest magnifique
candycrush,au,1.165.2,1,"Hate the new update. 
Seriously stopped playing."
candycrush,au,1.165.2,2,"My game kept starting from the beginning , this is the second time it happened . Too bad candy crush is fun and addictive game , now I can‚Äôt be bother doing it all over again ."
candycrush,au,1.165.2,5,Cool
candycrush,au,1.164.0,5,I love this game but the past couple of weeks the game crashes every time and I need to restart my phone to play
candycrush,au,1.164.0,5,Best game in the universe love how there is levels
candycrush,au,1.164.0,4,Loving this game but when I try to buy from the store I get no progress.  This is a recent development so hoping this can be fixed.
candycrush,au,1.164.0,1,Should give more options üò°üò°üò°üò°
candycrush,au,1.164.0,5,"It such a pain that I have to wait forever to get new levels coming after I finished my level 5825.. and when new levels finally available still I can‚Äôt join the competition because I had to wait for another ‚Äúnew levels coming soon‚Äù after probably finished only 10/15 levels not sure. So dear candy crush team, would you guys please fix my problem of the ‚Äútoo long waiting for the new levels?‚Äù Thanks so much in advance y‚Äôall!! Since I love this game too much not to play for a sec, specially on the weekend! üò£üò≠ü§™ü§£üòç‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
candycrush,au,1.164.0,3,"My freckles , fishes and colouring bombs have gone of my game on this iPad ,I never used them"
candycrush,au,1.164.0,1,"I‚Äôve been playing this game for years but for some reason ALL my progress has been lost (I was on level 2700ish). The game froze a couple of times and then when it worked I was back to level 1. Not happy! And to be honest, after reading your support section on how to get it back,  I cannot be bothered working out how to get it fixed. You‚Äôve lost a loyal player! App will now be deleted."
candycrush,au,1.164.0,1,"This game is dangerously addictive and designed that way ... set up like poker machines to get you hooked & keep you hooked. 
I deleted it & I already feel lighter & calmer.
I was playing at night & having restless sleep & even bad dreams which I never had before I got hooked on this game.
Glad to be rid of it. If you care about your health & well being, DON‚ÄôT DOWNLOAD ‚ò†Ô∏è"
candycrush,au,1.164.0,5,It‚Äôs really good but it could use some more prizes regularly because when I can‚Äôt pass a level and I‚Äôve used all of my boosters also more lives. Other than that it‚Äôs a great game.
candycrush,au,1.164.0,5,"5 Stars. It‚Äôs addictive. It is want you wanted. Don‚Äôt listen to other reviews, it is fantastic. Download the game and see for yourself. Ever wonder why this game was so popular? Because it‚Äôs perfection."
candycrush,au,1.164.0,1,"After an unsolicited contact I tried to get information on privacy settings but strangely that was the only piece of information that didn‚Äôt open, what a strange coincidence. So I deleted the game, no money from me."
candycrush,au,1.164.0,1,My candy crush pig bank is full with gold yet it shows my amount of gold only being two and it can‚Äôt go up because my piggy bank is full
candycrush,au,1.163.0,5,This is the best! My mother and grandmother have been playing this for years! They never get off it. My grandma says she is level 2000 or something. My friend lies about his parents levels he says that his parents are on 10789 but he is lying obviously ü§£
candycrush,au,1.163.0,5,Great game lots to keep you interested
candycrush,au,1.163.0,5,Fun and relaxing
candycrush,au,1.163.0,1,Hi poop
candycrush,au,1.163.0,1,"Again and again
Please fix your boosters
They don't always work 
Thankfully, I'm now losing interest in the game."
candycrush,au,1.163.0,5,Love this game best APP
candycrush,au,1.162.1,1,Have updated to iPhone 11 and the app freezes on accept terms and conditions. Have deleted and reinstalled with no luck. Look s like my addiction is cured
candycrush,au,1.162.1,5,Make more games for 4+es
candycrush,au,1.162.1,5,"i actually do like this app but its very annoying at the same time. I cant get past level 33. I even uninstalled it and tried again.STILL STUCK ON 33  grrrrr.

I got to 506 and it crashed again . But still reinstalled. .Having to start again"
candycrush,au,1.162.1,1,"Game is entertaining enough - when waiting for dentist/doctors/etc's appointment!! Upgraded game and could mute ad quickly so didn't have to listen to it... then upgraded again, and it's back to mute delay! Also, ad's freezing, interrupting game!! Fix the mute delay once and for all!!"
candycrush,au,1.162.1,4,Need more than 5 lives at a time. If you use all your 5 lives you have to wait 30mins for 1 more if you run out. At least give the players 10 lives at a time! People spend enough money and time that we deserve that.
candycrush,au,1.162.1,5,"Love this game but is is very addictive!!! Bit annoyed with the fact that I accidentally went into a level that I had already beaten and when I left the game because I did not want to play that level again I lost a life! You should be able to check out a previous level and not loose a life when you decide not to play it. Please fix this. Edit: this was fixed. Thank you!

This is an addition to my review. This time it is regarding the sugar drops change and free daily booster change. Still love the game but I would like the free boosters you can collect not to be time limited. Too often I get a booster that I can‚Äôt even use on the level I am on. Please change this back."
candycrush,au,1.162.1,1,"I love candy crush but the random crashes and freezing is really annoying me.
Please fix whatever is going on."
candycrush,au,1.161.0,4,"So I went to play Candy Crush like 30 minutes ago. I‚Äôm on level 1745. 
When it finishes loading and goes to the levels map it says I‚Äôve played EVERY SINGLE LEVEL and that I‚Äôm waiting for new levels. All my LIVES that people had given me were gone and ALL MY BOOSTS were gone too!!!! It wouldn‚Äôt even let me play past levels!!!
So I restarted the app, didn‚Äôt do anything and then I turned my phone off and on and went back to Candy Crush.
My current level is back BUT ALL my LIVES that people gave me and ALL MY BOOSTS are gone!!!!
Seriously?!?! I had saved up over 30 lives and over 30 boosts!!!!
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!
What the heck happened?!?!
SOMEONE BETTER FIX THIS!!!!! ASAP!!!!!"
candycrush,au,1.161.0,5,"Whats with the ads taking 60 seconds at the moment ? I'd rather not bother getting a bonus, if they can't get their spiel across in 40 seconds or under they shouldn't be placing ads on the game."
candycrush,au,1.161.0,1,"I have been buying the in game gold for a while and I noticed that the more I‚Äôve brought, the developers keeps on reducing the number of gold bars for the same price as before! 

Did you really think that I am so addicted to this game that I can‚Äôt give it up? I have enough of your greed! Game effin deleted!!!"
candycrush,au,1.161.0,5,What is your level bro
candycrush,au,1.161.0,4,Have been playing candy crush for years am finally getting through hard levels easier
candycrush,au,1.161.0,2,"This game is kind of meh. It is fun, but sometimes just plain boring. I think of it as üòí. I was disappointed"
candycrush,au,1.161.0,5,Good game. Would like unlimited turns though!!
candycrush,au,1.161.0,5,Got to enjoy pitting my mind against great odds and I enjoy it very much
candycrush,au,1.161.0,5,I always play this game a lot
candycrush,au,1.161.0,3,"The latest update won‚Äôt let you connect to Facebook or King kingdom for game saves, had no problem before this update. Going into technical advice and they claim its permissions with Facebook. Best not to install the update if you can help it.!!"
candycrush,au,1.161.0,3,I love playing the game but I seriously hate the 9 or 10 unnecessary extra screens that come up in between each level.
candycrush,au,1.161.0,1,"What is wrong with the latest update .. Halloween.
As soon as you open it .. There is the orange screen and then a Black screen and nothing happens.
Please fix. Christine"
candycrush,au,1.161.0,4,Love the game but it keeps closing on me and restarting the level making me loose my helmet :(
candycrush,au,1.161.0,1,"Game does whatever it wants it too.. rigged. 
 Every time I go back and play it again after long periods of time I understand why I stopped in the first place.."
candycrush,au,1.161.0,5,Awesome game
candycrush,au,1.160.0,5,Love the crackling sounds on my iPhone X. Just so enjoyable to play.
candycrush,au,1.160.0,3,Has ANYONE hit jackpot on the daily booster wheel? I always stop right before or after the jackpot strip. I‚Äôve notice how the wheel slow down or speed up slightly every time the needle comes close to stopping on the jackpot strip...!? Rigged?
candycrush,au,1.160.0,4,My youngest son plays it for as long as he can and loves it. It also helps him out to calm down as he has special needs
candycrush,au,1.160.0,5,The best way to unwind after work!!
candycrush,au,1.160.0,5,It‚Äôs so much fun!
candycrush,au,1.160.0,5,This is fun
candycrush,au,1.160.0,3,"I have always enjoyed this game, but on reaching level 1459 I now can't stand it. It is frustrating and I have stopped playing it as you have made it so difficult to complete these levels without constantly spending money. Put simply; I've stopped spending money with you."
candycrush,au,1.160.0,5,"So silly, so much fun..."
candycrush,au,1.160.0,4,Why can‚Äôt I open my messenger envelope in the top right hand corner.  I wish to send lives and never get the chance to do so.
candycrush,au,1.160.0,2,"The last update seems to cause a bug where you can‚Äôt leave the daily reward screen. It just continues to ask you to open time and time again and you can‚Äôt play the actual game. Before then, it was a great game I loved!"
candycrush,au,1.160.0,5,This game is very addictive and it's so fun
candycrush,au,1.160.0,5,This app is amazing
candycrush,au,1.160.0,1,Sick to death of this game locking up and not being able to make any moves....you need to fix this!!
candycrush,au,1.160.0,1,"After a while it takes several attempts to compete almost every level
Really starts getting more boring and frustrating than chill like it is supposed to be"
candycrush,au,1.160.0,5,What a wonderful game to play
candycrush,au,1.160.0,5,Wow this game is so much fun
candycrush,au,1.160.0,5,Enjoy every minute. Fabulous.
candycrush,au,1.159.0,2,I was stuck on level 296 for like 4 hours!! this is too hard
candycrush,au,1.159.0,1,Biggest waste of time and way too addictive. Do yourself a favour and avoid it
candycrush,au,1.159.0,1,"Would love to continue playing this game but no longer connects to WiFi so can‚Äôt save game, can‚Äôt get help from king community as can‚Äôt log in! It won‚Äôt connect. Tried everything but won‚Äôt ‚Äòsee‚Äô the WiFi signal and yes there is nothing wrong with our WiFi . Works for everything else. Please fix this endless problem or at least have the courtesy to reply!"
candycrush,au,1.159.0,1,I have played a level for weeks but there is no way past it unless you pay money this is a rip off. I‚Äôm going to delete this app
candycrush,au,1.159.0,3,"I enjoy the challenge it keeps my brain active
Dicaw"
candycrush,au,1.159.0,5,Awesome bro
candycrush,au,1.158.1,5,Good and challenging game with many levels to test your abilities
candycrush,au,1.158.1,5,"It‚Äôs great when you get a reward at levels, but I prefer getting a reward that I can save for later use. I always seem to get a timed reward when I have run out of lives and therefore can‚Äôt use the times reward"
candycrush,au,1.158.1,1,Levels such as 4639 are flawed. Why have booster when you can‚Äôt play them. Why have space bot and earn top reward when you lose that ability because of levels like this. Biggest flaw is you can not move candies from under a crystal. Even though your own hint is showing this should be possible therefore you don‚Äôt get auto shuffle. Seriously surely someone should be checking this. You earn millions a day and then you have simple flaws like this. Really disappointed and I am on the verge of deleting! Also timed rewards is a con. Especially as you have to wait so long for lives to replenish.  Watch! I will not be spending one single cent on your game. Will go on other games! Poor very poor.. remember who makes you all this money.. don‚Äôt bite the hand that feeds you!
candycrush,au,1.158.1,2,There are so many changes in the game that don‚Äôt make sense and it isn‚Äôt very fun to play anymore
candycrush,au,1.158.1,4,"I am on level 482 and every game stops me going any further with, Bomb exploded.   Not every second game but every game.
Crazy, I am deleting game as it is too  ridiculous, give us a chance at least,"
candycrush,au,1.158.1,5,"I‚Äôm currently on level 5240 waiting for more new levels to be released. Not sure if I‚Äôm the first one in the world lol I would love to know. I hope Candy crush team can advise. The group that I‚Äôm playing with; the second player is from Hong Kong has reached the level 5014. 
So is it automatically I‚Äôm playing with the top players or just whatever the group is as a random? I look forward to an answer. Cheers! Keep going guys you‚Äôre simply the best!"
candycrush,au,1.157.0,5,it is so awsome but the prices are a little bit high
candycrush,au,1.157.0,1,I urge you to change the reloading of lives back to 30 mins. It is utterly insane and money hungry to think people are going to keep buying lives. Giving bonuses for 1 hour when you can‚Äôt even use them is ridiculous. Worst update ever.
candycrush,au,1.157.0,1,"The latest update having to wait 50 minutes before a new life is given...I‚Äôm not spending anymore money on this app and game...Been playing forever, Level 3800 and really turned off by having to wait for free lives. Lost me as a customer!!"
candycrush,au,1.157.0,1,"So annoyed that now it‚Äôs 1hr to refill a life. It‚Äôs a great game. Just annoying that now if I want to refill my lives I need to pay for it or wait one hour for one life. 5 hours is a really long time. 
Sorry guys one star cos it‚Äôs now more a waist of time to play rather than being relaxed."
candycrush,au,1.157.0,1,Lives used to take 30 mins to replenish. Now they take an hour each. Why have you guys made such a lousy change?  Really annoyed.  You won‚Äôt be getting nearly as much ad revenue.  Poorly played developers.
candycrush,au,1.157.0,3,Have been playing this game for years and love the challenge. Not happy that the time between lives has increased by 20 minutes. Why gave you spoiled this?
candycrush,au,1.157.0,5,Fun and challenging - the best of both worlds!
candycrush,au,1.157.0,1,Disappointing that you have to wait a whole hour for ONE new life. Not worth the wait.
candycrush,au,1.157.0,3,Candy crush is now making you wait an hour to get a new life. Although it is incredibly frustrating it is finally giving me the motivation to stop wasting my time. I‚Äôve been chastising myself on how much time I spend on this game. Time to do something productive. Frustrating but liberating.
candycrush,au,1.157.0,1,15 goes and still can‚Äôt beat level 337. With over 5000 levels. Only looking to chill out but make it too hard. Poor form onto the next game
candycrush,au,1.157.0,5,Relaxing
candycrush,au,1.157.0,3,Most annoying thing playing this game is the next move prompt. It‚Äôs immediate and the prompted move jumps up and down constantly. It‚Äôs just annoying. Feels like you don‚Äôt ever get to play your own game. Even to the point of making moves you shouldn‚Äôt just to spite it lol
candycrush,au,1.155.0,1,You stole all my candy ycunts
candycrush,au,1.155.0,5,I cannot beat level 136 because I can get the chocolate map square thing I have been stuck on level 136 for three months please help
candycrush,au,1.155.0,5,Love this game
candycrush,au,1.155.0,5,Have been playing this for a long time on my iPad and am up to game 2183 but cannot get this level on my iPhone  ....Have to start from scratch!
candycrush,au,1.155.0,1,I don‚Äôt play as much anymore. Not since the introduction of the timed boosts where you are forced to use a boost in your game. I play without boosts and it was annoying enough to have to deliberately lose a life when the ‚Äúboost bot‚Äù was introduced. Now I have to wait an hour after I get my daily prize or sugar candy bonuses until the boosts expire. Is there a way I can turn off these unwanted boosts?
candycrush,au,1.155.0,5,Amazing game
candycrush,au,1.155.0,5,The game is good I love it a lot it is so much fun .üòÄüòÖüòÉüòÑüòÅ üòÖüòÄüòÄIf you are the maker fo this game. It is so good üòä
candycrush,au,1.155.0,1,"I‚Äôm now playing level 2327 (just completed) after about 100 attempts to be hit with another Super Hard Level straight after. 

The game used to be fun but now it is all about spending money to complete levels. 

Have decided to turn it off for good

Save your money before you get into the high levels as they are impossible"
candycrush,au,1.155.0,5,"Love playing candy crush 
Still as awesome and addictive as always"
candycrush,au,1.155.0,2,"Used to love this but now it‚Äôs too pushy with the hints and everything is at 100 mph
Too fast and don‚Äôt enjoy anymore."
candycrush,au,1.155.0,5,Addictive and great fun
candycrush,au,1.155.0,5,"A great game, keeps mind and fingers active, helps with arthritis also a colorful game. Brain gets active also."
candycrush,au,1.155.0,1,"Well done King, you‚Äôve now managed another clever con, it‚Äôs all very well giving us 15 mins of jelly fish or whatever boost you may win, but quite another when you can‚Äôt use said booster because you dictate what boosters we can play, I notice there aren‚Äôt any good ones like the flying saucer. I will probably delete this game now (after 8 years), I‚Äôm glad I was able to help making you millionaires"
candycrush,au,1.155.0,1,"Lost interest when it took 5 mins to get through the pop ups when opening the game. Then a further minute of pop ups between levels. Not worth dealing with all that rubbishy, I just wanted to play the levels."
candycrush,au,1.155.0,2,I recently have issues with the Candy Crush Saga as it keep appearing another same name App.
candycrush,au,1.155.0,1,It‚Äôs evil candy don‚Äôt play
candycrush,au,1.155.0,5,"Often love this game, but when a level is impossible stop using it for months. Currently at level 1443 and impossible in 12 moves. So you have lost me (again) üò°‚òπÔ∏è"
candycrush,au,1.155.0,1,Black screen when u click extra steps.
candycrush,au,1.155.0,3,Motto of Candy Crush relax and pass fun time but not anymore some of the Levels are ridiculously hard and frustrating I am stuck on Lvl 1136 those popcorn looking thing take so many turns to crack and then not enough turns it‚Äôs crazy and the game sooo controlled will be a miracle to spin JACKPOT!!!! one day also to get life in 5-10 minutes will be awesome not happy üò°üò°
candycrush,au,1.155.0,5,I love candycrush!!! It is so addictive and fun I love the levels and I love how 3D it is.I recommend this game for people who want a challenge and loads of levels üç≠üç¨üç™üéÇüç®üçßüç°
candycrush,au,1.154.1,5,"Candy crush is seriously good. Only negative thing I can say is that you‚Äôre not as generous as other games. For example, I just watched your ‚Äúthank you‚Äù video re level 3000. That‚Äôs lovely and all but how bout some free gold or some sort of other pack ;) we shouldn‚Äôt expect freebies of course but it seems to be the biggest difference between you and others. They have giveaways for most holidays and events. Just a thought. Other than that, I love candy crush."
candycrush,au,1.154.1,5,Candy crush is soooooooooo addicting and I love it. It goes on for ages and I LOVE IT
candycrush,au,1.154.1,4,After being on 587 I updated my phone and took me back to the beginning. They have given me a couple of things to do. Didn't happen
candycrush,au,1.154.1,5,Love this game. My go to game when I‚Äôm bored
candycrush,au,1.154.1,5,Improved faster love it
candycrush,au,1.154.1,5,"Just did an update and have lost all my levels, was over 300 and now all gone!!!
What‚Äôs going on and can you fix this"
candycrush,au,1.154.1,5,I really love this game my mum and I play this game together all the time I think my mum would give this game a five out of ten!!!!!!
candycrush,au,1.154.1,2,"It‚Äôs ok but some levels are ridiculous. Takes too long to get through, not enough rewards. How about the ability to win 5 lives? Toon Blast has more to offer. Perhaps see what rewards & challenges they have and do something similar."
candycrush,au,1.154.1,3,Dynamic duo would be an awesome idea but a lot of players it isn‚Äôt longer loading for. I lost a 12 win streak because it won‚Äôt load another challenge and I have very good wifi  before anyone asks! If used read your players support pg u would see quite a few comments and complaints about this. Pls fix as it‚Äôs not fair those it works for get extra boosts and get ahead faster on finish level first challenges. How is tat fair?!
candycrush,au,1.154.0,3,I paid for extras but did not receive them. A message saying no money was taken from your account came up but money was taken from my account. Not happy
candycrush,au,1.154.0,1,Didn‚Äôt receive gold bars after I was promised. Can‚Äôt win levels after update.
candycrush,au,1.154.0,5,"I‚Äôve been playing this game on and off now for years and it only just occurred to me that in that time I have spun the wheel perhaps thousands of times and never ever landed on the jackpot! But I‚Äôm constantly being asked to purchase things! Coincidence, doubt it. For that reason alone I‚Äôll never spend my money on this game."
candycrush,au,1.154.0,5,Candy crush is great fun addictive it‚Äôs awesome but there‚Äôs one problem it takes forever to get more lives.
candycrush,au,1.154.0,4,So like this is a great game I really love it it‚Äôs like AMAZING I play Fishdom as well but I really like candy crush üòçü•∞üòòü§£üòÇüòÖüòÜüòÅü§©ü•≥üòéü§™üòúüòõüòùüòãüòôüòóü•∞üòçüôÉüòâüòáüòåüòäüôÇüòÅüòÜüòÖüòÉüòÄ

candycrush,au,1.154.0,5,I keep coming back to it.  Great problem solving and FUN
candycrush,au,1.153.0,1,won that popsicle event for 6h prizes but they don't show up on the levels
candycrush,au,1.153.0,5,I love this game it can be good for your brain
candycrush,au,1.153.0,2,"Hate the new upgrade where when you collect the sugar drops you don‚Äôt get the reward instead you get 15 minutes of a free booster but you might be on your last life and you can‚Äôt even use it! Very frustrating, nearly ready to give up as there is no incentive to collect the sugar drops!"
candycrush,au,1.153.0,5,Great
candycrush,au,1.153.0,5,"Lots of fun/ cheerful / colourful/
My friends live it too"
candycrush,au,1.153.0,4,It‚Äôs good but the amount of times you make a special booster and it just changes to a normal candy is ridiculous! I‚Äôm am finding more and more glitches in the game the higher I go in levels
candycrush,au,1.153.0,1,The game is not as good as it use to be... there is no challenge. It‚Äôs just easy not as much fun.
candycrush,au,1.153.0,5,Very addictive
candycrush,au,1.153.0,1,"If you make a level so difficult that it‚Äôs impossible to get through, it‚Äôs time to give up. Stuck on the same level 522, which now seems forever and not going to waste any more time on it 
Sad as I really love this game.  How about giving a life line to advance through to the next level."
candycrush,au,1.153.0,5,Great fun
candycrush,au,1.153.0,4,Don‚Äôt know why but unable to play. Candy Crush Crash. Have tried to reload app numerous times. Have tried various ways to get started again without success. Can someone please help.
candycrush,au,1.153.0,5,Grea5 game haven‚Äôt played for years .....
candycrush,au,1.152.0,1,Should have an option to turn off ‚Äúcan you reach the finishing line first‚Äù. NO I DON‚ÄôT CARE IF I OR ANYONE ELSE CAN DO IT OR NOT I JUST WANT TO QUIETLY ENJOY TGE GAME.
candycrush,au,1.152.0,2,"This game used to be better without all the annoying pop-ups before and after each level. I really don‚Äôt need to see the same things 50 times a day! üôÑ And after the recent update, it keeps telling me to log into my fb account even though I never logged out. If these issues are fixed I‚Äôd give this game a 5 star."
candycrush,au,1.152.0,5,"Great fun, with some difficult levels which take time to conquer"
candycrush,au,1.152.0,4,Had 86 gold bars and they just disappeared with an update. This is a problem thet needs fixing and bars restored
candycrush,au,1.151.0,1,"As of the new update when I select my boosters I can not exit the level and come back to it to rearrange the placement of the boosters, it now has a set spot for each level and I can‚Äôt use them together anymore. Not sure if this was done on purpose but please change it back to how it was!"
candycrush,au,1.151.0,1,what happening to the randomised shuffle !! makes game extremely frustrating and makes me not want to play anymore
candycrush,au,1.151.0,1,CHANGE IT BACK!!! WE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE A RANDOMISED SHUFFLE EVERYTIME I GO BACK TO THE LEVEL. IM NOT PLAYING IT UNTIL YOU FIX THIS MASSIVE ISSUE. Shame on you.
candycrush,au,1.151.0,2,I like the stress reliever to many advertisements in free version and they are getting longer far too many adds in free version 30 second adds
candycrush,au,1.151.0,2,It‚Äôs a fun game but it‚Äôs tipped toward getting your money. The few times I spent money on extra lives or boosters the levels are heaps easier to complete but soon after become significantly harder. Seems like they do this in order to make you want to buy in-app purchases. It ruins the game. Maybe it‚Äôs a coincidence but I doubt it.
candycrush,au,1.151.0,2,Candy doesnt reshuffle when you restart a level. Always getting the same placement! Change it back
candycrush,au,1.151.0,1,Fix it pls
candycrush,au,1.151.0,3,Why mess with something that isn‚Äôt broken? The randomisation of candy placements when you start a level has been taken away. Means you can no longer restart a level that has no good starting moves. Change it back please!
candycrush,au,1.151.0,5,"I had this games for years. Just keep coming back every now and then. It is still a good time killer, even after all those years."
candycrush,au,1.151.0,5,Good game
candycrush,au,1.151.0,5,Very addictive fantastic
candycrush,au,1.151.0,1,"Ive been an avid player of the game and have spent months accumulating boosters to use on hard levels, some of which I have purchased, and most achieved as awards. I have just updated the app, and BOOM! .... I‚Äôve Lost all of my saved colour bombs, stripped/wrapped lollies, jelly fish etc. I‚Äôve contacted support but have had no joy in getting my boosters back. I‚Äôm not happy. I‚Äôve lost all motivation to continue playing Candy Crush as the levels are getting increasingly harder and I‚Äôve got no boosters to get me through these levels. Hence, if my boosters are not reinstated, I‚Äôll be off to find another game to play. Feeling pretty crushed."
candycrush,au,1.151.0,5,"It's SWEEET, TASTY AND DIVINE"
candycrush,au,1.151.0,1,"Seriously what is with the new diagonal move that uses 2 moves, that is ridiculous, as now if you are stuck you have no choice but to use 2 moves rather than the game reshuffling, making it harder to complete levels......very cheeky!"
candycrush,au,1.150.1,5,I love this game my dad is almost up to level 1000 and I‚Äôm put to 40 this game has a lot of boosters and power ups it has colour bombs swipers donuts the switch band lolly pops and the little candy snacks for bombs and much more stuff I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
candycrush,au,1.150.1,1,Trash the game plays it self
candycrush,au,1.150.1,1,"My Earth worm was hospitalised after I hit a double freckle. Wondering about the insurance, will candy qunt insure it‚Äôs fees which are a staggering $30 000.

candycrush,au,1.150.1,2,"Why do I need to join Facebook to continue playing or pay $1.00 every 20 mins, why not just charge for the app in the first place.
This was my when I first started playing years ago but I never posted.  Now years later I am playing again and wondering has anyone actually spun the jackpot on the free daily spin?"
candycrush,au,1.150.1,5,Fantastic game and awesome choice on putting 15 extra levels every week

candycrush,au,1.149.0,1,There is no option to log into the right Facebook so it keeps logging into my partners but there isn‚Äôt any option to switch Facebook accounts.

candycrush,au,1.149.0,5,"I love love love the fact that there is no ads. It‚Äôs one of the reasons I have stuck with Candy Crush for so long. However, the only thing that annoys me is how quickly the lives can run out! When you‚Äôre on a level that‚Äôs super hard or has countdown candy, you‚Äôre lives go super quick. 
Maybe getting rid of the lives feature OR add more lives. I hate waiting for them to come back when all I want to do is try and finish the level."
candycrush,au,1.149.0,1,I was up to level 2543 and they ask me to sign in with Facebook and had to start all over again! Not happy
candycrush,au,1.149.0,1,I have been playing this game for quite some time now but in the last 2 months I can‚Äôt open the app without it shutting down or not going past the loading page. I have updated it and it still won‚Äôt work. Not happy.
candycrush,au,1.149.0,2,Fix level 1879 it‚Äôs currently next to unwinable.
candycrush,au,1.149.0,2,The game progress should be able to save at Game Center not only Facebook
candycrush,au,1.149.0,1,I lost all my progress and I am not happy to have to start all over again
candycrush,au,1.149.0,3,"To finish this level, I used my lucky spin to get 5 extra goes, and a couple of swaps and lollipops. At the end of the completed ‚ÄòWON‚Äô game I had to close my tablet, did not return until the next day and my win has been lost or forgotten? 
Goodbye Candy Crush, this is not the first time this has happened, you are making people pay more and more to get additional help items."

candycrush,au,1.149.0,2,It‚Äôs a good game but recent change to only 30 bars for $4.99 instead of previous 60 is a rip off

candycrush,au,1.148.0,2,"I am SICK and TIRED and FED UP with the difficulty of levels. Just because I‚Äôm completing levels over 4000 shouldn‚Äôt mean they are 4000 times as difficult as level 1.

candycrush,au,1.150.1,5,Fantastic game and awesome choice on putting 15 extra levels every week
candycrush,au,1.149.0,5,app
candycrush,au,1.149.0,1,I am on level 4745 on my phone and it won‚Äôt let me go any further but on my computer in the same account it lets me go further and won‚Äôt update on my phone
candycrush,au,1.149.0,5,I love it please download itüç¨üç≠üç´üç©üç¶üç®üßÅüç∞üéÇ
candycrush,au,1.149.0,3,"The daily booster wheel is always greyed out & doesn‚Äôt give me the option to stop just stops whenever it wants & the Dynamic Duo rarely loads!! I can exit the game, do all the updates & nothing fixes this. How can I help my partner when I can‚Äôt see what we‚Äôre supposed to be achieving."
candycrush,au,1.149.0,1,There is no option to log into the right Facebook so it keeps logging into my partners but there isn‚Äôt any option to switch Facebook accounts. Trying to go through the help system won‚Äôt even let me try fix the issue because I can‚Äôt write to them as it‚Äôs an automatic answering system
candycrush,au,1.149.0,5,"I love love love the fact that there is no ads. It‚Äôs one of the reasons I have stuck with Candy Crush for so long. However, the only thing that annoys me is how quickly the lives can run out! When you‚Äôre on a level that‚Äôs super hard or has countdown candy, you‚Äôre lives go super quick. 
Maybe getting rid of the lives feature OR add more lives. I hate waiting for them to come back when all I want to do is try and finish the level."
candycrush,au,1.149.0,1,I was up to level 2543 and they ask me to sign in with Facebook and had to start all over again! Not happy
candycrush,au,1.149.0,1,I have been playing this game for quite some time now but in the last 2 months I can‚Äôt open the app without it shutting down or not going past the loading page. I have updated it and it still won‚Äôt work. Not happy.
candycrush,au,1.149.0,2,Fix level 1879 it‚Äôs currently next to unwinable.
candycrush,au,1.149.0,2,The game progress should be able to save at Game Center not only Facebook
candycrush,au,1.149.0,1,I lost all my progress and I am not happy to have to start all over again
candycrush,au,1.149.0,3,"To finish this level, I used my lucky spin to get 5 extra goes, and a couple of swaps and lollipops. At the end of the completed ‚ÄòWON‚Äô game I had to close my tablet, did not return until the next day and my win has been lost or forgotten? 
Goodbye Candy Crush, this is not the first time this has happened, you are making people pay more and more to get additional help items."
candycrush,au,1.149.0,3,"I enjoy the game 100%. But,I bought 10 gold bars for $2.99 and you never gave it to me !!!! I‚Äôm Sianunwin and I would like all my gold bars ü•¥"
candycrush,au,1.149.0,2,It‚Äôs a good game but recent change to only 30 bars for $4.99 instead of previous 60 is a rip off
candycrush,au,1.149.0,5,Obsessed
candycrush,au,1.149.0,1,"The game is fine, but for some reason the most recent update makes your phone vibrate every single time you make a move - incredibly annoying! Candy crush, STOP TRYING TO ‚ÄúIMPROVE‚Äù THINGS!"
candycrush,au,1.148.0,5,"Sooooooooooo addictive. I can't stop playing. Absolutely amazingüëçüëåüíñ.

candycrush,au,1.149.0,2,"This used to be a cheaper app for in app purchasing. But now prices have increased and the items have reduced. You used to get get 15 gold bars for 1.79 in the last year it has doubled and you now only get 10 gold bars. 
Greedy!!! 
It‚Äôs definitely a way to stop people playing."
candycrush,au,1.149.0,5,I believe that this game is the best
candycrush,au,1.149.0,5,I like candy crush
candycrush,au,1.149.0,5,"I really like candy crush because there are no ads unless you choose!

candycrush,au,1.149.0,3,"I‚Äôve had candy crush for years! Love the game, I‚Äôve spent more money on it than I‚Äôd like to admit, there is one thing that I am however really disappointed about.... after all these years, I STILL have never ever seen what the jackpot is on the daily spins. I‚Äôve gotten pretty close a few hundred times but it always seems to glitch last second and keep spinning that little bit more. Surely after all these years someone has seen the jackpot????!!"
candycrush,au,1.148.0,2,"I am SICK and TIRED and FED UP with the difficulty of levels. Just because I‚Äôm completing levels over 4000 shouldn‚Äôt mean they are 4000 times as difficult as level 1. I am consistently faced with extreme, nightmare, very hard and hard levels and given sweet F.A. moves to complete, time bombs, barricades, choc and streamers requiring multiple matches to clear (all in the same level even). There is NOTHING relaxing, it‚Äôs beyond challenging and I find I don‚Äôt want to play."
candycrush,au,1.148.0,5,Great for Grandmas who don‚Äôt like the killing and warring games.
candycrush,au,1.148.0,1,I so don‚Äôt like it. When on level 3 I stoped playing it because it was not fun at all. They did the levels for you and I wanted to do them my self.
candycrush,us,1.196.1.1,2,I want a game that I can play when I have time to play. I don‚Äôt want to sit and wait 30 minutes for the thing to reset. If I wanted that I‚Äôd read a book
candycrush,us,1.196.1.1,1,Another update and it did not correct the loading issue. Game is unplayable
candycrush,us,1.196.1.1,5,"At night when I close my eyes to sleep, all I can see in my head is candy crush. It‚Äôs bad lol. The loading screen always says ‚Äúescape the stress of today‚Äù but LET ME TELL YOU. IVE HAD MORE CANDY CRUSH CRISISES THAN DAYS IN MY LIFE. anyhow it‚Äôs a pretty good game. Download it at your own risk though. I can‚Äôt focus on anything but this game now"
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,"I am now on level 3359it‚Äôs impossible with the number of jellies you need to get and free the 3 acorns, when you have so few moves! This is ridiculous and not fun and hardly relaxing! I‚Äôm ready to ditch Candy Crush altogether! I like a challenge but don‚Äôt like feeling like I have to buy my way to a win!  Terrible!!!!"
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,2,Every time I make a purchase it robs me and the game is rigged .
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,4,Unable to open App for the past week
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,Amazing
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,4,This game has come a long way and I love the music on here. I can actually write lyric to this lol! Yeah it a fun game.
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,My candy crush no longer opens so I‚Äôm not able to play but enjoyed it when I was able to play
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,Wow. This is torture I haven‚Äôt even got close to finishing this horrible level. Unbelievably ridiculously hard. Certainly not enough moves to complete this level. I guess it‚Äôs just luck. Very very tricky. Can‚Äôt even get close to finishing I do everything correct and can‚Äôt finish. Wow. Really really ridiculously hard. I‚Äôve been at for a long time
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,"The game is amazing but it is also difficult, there should be more ways to get lives than asking a friend and purchasing them. I love playing the game but I lose those 5 lives in no time."
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,"I think it needs a few new power ups
And maybe some different type of currency and also I think it needs some easy levels throughout the whole game I think it‚Äôs fun but it really does need a change! Pls do listen to me!
I think there should be a custom level building place where u could make ur own levels and try them, and then u can send then to a friend or someone else like a relative who plays the game those are just a few things that need to be added but I have too many....... but pls add something new but pls  make it FREE"
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,2,"App has not been functioning properly since 2/22. Stuck on loading screen. I‚Äôve done all the expected troubleshooting tips yet the issue remains. Please fix, CC Developers! I do love this game and enjoy playing everyday."
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,Please fix! Not loading!
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,4,"So far so delicious.
Ha ha!"
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,3,"3000 plus levels in and app freezes once or twice a week, requiring I delete and redownload.  So frustrating."
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,"I don't know if the latest update ruined this game or what the cause is, but I've spend 100 lives trying to get past 5 levels. It used to be fun before when we could at least get through a race with 5 lives, but not now. Probably going to uninstall it as the fun is gone."
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,Helpful!
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,3,It comes with no User Manual so you have to figure it out on your own.
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,I haven‚Äôt even download it but I already hate it
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,"The game is designed to make you stuck on a level that you get so frustrated you buy the add one or boosters. Don‚Äôt do it. One they over charge you. I‚Äôve seen I‚Äôve bought one booster, and get an Apple bill multiple times, multiple charges. I‚Äôve also screen recorded the level will be almost impossible to beat and when you have 1 move left it‚Äôll the board set up where as you‚Äôll win if you use, buy boosters, or spend your gold bars and guess what if you don‚Äôt have any of them, you‚Äôll want to buy them. Don‚Äôt do it. Either keep playing for free or delete this game. It used to be fun. It‚Äôs a total time/money waster now."
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,2,They‚Äôve started taking more and more incentives away from the players to encourage us to make numerous purchases. It started with small things and now you can see their trend. Deleted the app today.
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,"Fun game but when ever I get a lot of lives or boosts saved up, the app glitches and I have to remove it. I then log back in after I supposedly saved my progress and ALL OF MY LIVES AND SAVED BOOSTS ARE GONE! Very frustrating and annoying. That‚Äôs how they get you to pay for crap. Not me!!"
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,3,Ive been on level 3896 for weeks now. Seems since I questioned a charge to my account Ive been stuck- still love the game but i think im gonna take a break
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,I like this game
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,this is candy crush what do you expec
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,"Awesome game, but getting really annoyed my lives I receive from friends keep disappearing without using them. I had hundreds of lives and boosters and Sunday it crashed and everything is gone. In the past it‚Äôs just been lives. Now, I can‚Äôt even open the app. I expect once I do everything will be gone again."
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,I paid for some offer to keep play but I never got the lifes
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,2,"It‚Äôs one thing to have to view ads while playing various games. I get it that if I don‚Äôt pay, I have to view them.

candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,3,This game I like but it is a little boring. I say it is boring because you play the same thing every time and there is no jazz. It is fun if you have nothing to do though. I say it is a three star in my opinion.
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,I just spent $99.99 and the day after the app won‚Äôt load.  I notice that this has happened to many users after the latest update.   I‚Äôve sent in an email to King and the App Store in hopes I get a refund.  Not sure how else to reach out except contact my bank to reverse the charge.  Messaged candy crush on Instagram as well.
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,2,"As expected, the further you get, the harder the levels get. And the more boosts you need. And not a lot of chances to get boosts or extra lives. And lately It gets stuck on the open screen and WILL NOT load or open the game. With or without wifi. High or low reception. So I have to delete it and reload the app. And even if I log back into my profile, all my boosts are gone. Just done. I've had levels I've been stuck on for weeks trying to acrue enough boosts to pass levels and not spend money. I think I'm done with this after who knows how many years."
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,3,"Okay.  So I‚Äôam been putting this simple complaint off for awhile . But do anybody experience when purchasing more gold bars to play it take more money off card then it supposed to , Like for an example if I‚Äôam purchasing the 9.99 it charge my card $11 and some change , or if I‚Äôam purchasing the $5 one it charge me $7 and some change then sometimes it don‚Äôt take the money right away it will wait to see if I purchase anymore bars then then charge me for all the bars and then some later , or when you purchase , you get extra bars , but it never reflects in your account you wind up with less bars , has this happen to anyone else ?"
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,Check me out on Instagram @kingdayoungram
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,"I am disappointed, today I had to start all over. I went from level 4382 to level 1 because candy crush changed something in the privacy policy."
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,Can‚Äôt seem to stop!
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,Sweet game
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,2,This app is ok at times then at others if your not purchasing the add ins to get you to the next level they keep you stuck on the level for days. No more possible moves so they keep switching the moves every turn! Really I thought you guys would be doing better it‚Äôs still a pandemic!!!! I play this to keep calm clearly it‚Äôs not working!
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,"Hi candy crush developers,

You guys are not the greatest people on Earth, rather you guys are mean and scammers. I made a purchase for the infinite half hour lives pack that comes with all these candy bombs and what not, BUT I NEVER GOT THE PACK!! I contacted you guys via email and call. When I emailed they gave me a link to submit a forum stating my problem and no one got back to me so I took the matters into my own hands where I called your office. When I talked to a representative, right, they told me they could do nothing about it and that I should have ‚Äúmy account taken away?‚Äù Her name was Lisa. I talked to her and then she of hung up aggressively. Like slammed the phone down! Train your people better!"
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,Every time I make an in app purchase 2-3 extra purchases are added onto the bill that I never made and never received those items in app. A $2.99 purchase that I authorized ends with me being billed $15. No it‚Äôs not anyone else using my account. This happens every single time.
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,Awesome game
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,My game won‚Äôt load - frozen. 2/22/2021 til now

candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,2,"The game is addictive but developer created this game to rob gold from players, before quit the level game ask multiple question before exist but only take one accident click and it taken away gold from your inventory, of you spend real money to buy gold then your gold will be slip away just in one click without a warning gold being use."
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,:D
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,4,"Been playing for years now on level 2,504 currently so yeah I love it buttttt the new update took away winning free gold bars for achievements meaning the only way you can extend the game or your life is to pay for them before you had a chance to win them.

candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,"I‚Äôve been playing CC for years, and I have to say that I am so disappointed in the latest update.  They removed the chance to win gold bars in the fast race and instead put coconut wheels and other boosters as prizes.  It makes me not want to play anymore.  Also can‚Äôt stand the fact that they removed the free spin.  Such greedy people!"
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,"I am on level 4999, so that tells you how much I like the game. 

Need a new update, though!"
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,2,Whoever made this game please let me have the option to turn off his cause that‚Äôs the one thing about your game I hate
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,4,I need to know what to do when you loose how to keep going?  I have all these points and need to know how to keep them to move on. Is there someplace I can go check.
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,"I was at level 2532 when you did an update and I lost everything.  I‚Äôm now having to start over at Level one after four years to reach that level 2532. If it happens again, I will remove the app.  I didn‚Äôt play via Facebook or any other site....just on my phone.  I don‚Äôt even know how to ‚Äúsign in‚Äù to the Candy Crush site to try to recover back to that level with all of my helps/boosters in tact....and I had a lot!!"
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,Its just fun:)
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,Very good game!
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,"So I really like this game, and it has a great design but...it has some very annoying features. First off, it‚Äôs almost impossible to play without spending any money. I get that you need to make some money but the ONLY way to get bars without spending money is through races. Now normally I wouldn‚Äôt care but I‚Äôm only allowed to spend so much time on each app a day so I sorta can‚Äôt play 30 levels in 5 minutes. If you could make ANY other way to get bars that would be super helpful for me. Thank you and I really like this game and would recommend it to younger kids and people who have a lot of time on their hands."
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,Very nice game
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,It won‚Äôt open on my I phone. Loads and closes. What‚Äôs going on
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,4,I love this game but am wondering why i can only send a select few lives?
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,"This game used to be fun. Now it seems like the developers are bored. They keep making unnecessary tweaks. One week there‚Äôs a spin wheel at the end of a failed level, now it‚Äôs gone completely. Then they add a piggy bank which may or may not appear depending on the weekly update. What about the free bonuses that you used to get when you finish a level on the first try? Guess what? GONE! Build a bot or whatever: gone! Replaced with some other gimmick.  What‚Äôs changed now? The way that the candy ball thing turns all of the candies into stripes - it‚Äôs ‚Äúnerfed‚Äù (ie totally useless).  I can‚Äôt keep up.  This game is NO FUN. Bye King!"
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,This app is great for me when I am traveling and easy to play with
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,2,"I updated the game, but now it won‚Äôt open!??!"
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,I adore this game but my mom and dad don‚Äôt wonder why .love Niharika
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,"update needed, been frozen  and not starting up at all for 2 days"
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,üíùüíï
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,One good thing about this is there‚Äôs no adds when it means an app purchases it means you can still play the game for free but let‚Äôs say gold gold bars they buy you boosters but if you don‚Äôt have enough you can go in the shop and buy more just one bad thing every other level like when you‚Äôre in level 20 and you go up it gets really hard but on the rise that it‚Äôs great
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,3,Well been playing for years and as of 2-20-21 won‚Äôt open not sure how to uninstall it on iOS to try reinstalling it.
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,I have not been able to play since the last update. All it says is loading!!!!!!!! Please fix!!!!!!!
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,These been happening lately. I mainly play the game on my mobile. Afraid to re start it knowing I will lose all my boosters if I do that. Please fix it.
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,Fun until around 500. Then pay to win garbage.  Much better games out there if you‚Äôre willing to watch some ads such as JewelsMagic. Save yourself some frustration and stay away from this game.
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,How come when I lose I don‚Äôt get free spin that‚Äôs usually there every 2 days anymore?...I mean I love the game and still spend money why did y‚Äôall take this feature away??not cool
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,Part of the fun was the big blasts. Probably cheaper to design game that way whilst the cost is outrageous!!  Such a rip!
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,3,Why does it say there are no more moves when you can see that there is üò°
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,"Since last update, game won‚Äôt open"
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,Love the challenge. Makes me think.
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,This game is rigged to cost you money. Most times you end up with one square left and have to buy  a booster to move on. I have been playing for years and just had to play a game 16 times to win . As soon as I bought a booster I won.  They have also changed the game to there advantage. Used to give you extra 3 moves every 24 hours. Stopped doing that . It also gets more expensive to buy booster saw you go. I think they should be investigated for fraud as the game is set to let you win or lose depending on how much you spend. No how good you are. They track how much you play when you log in.
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,I love this game!!
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,Unless you spend money you will spend days getting past stages. Definitely not a stress reliever when you have to keep playing the same level day after day.
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,Uhm... where do I start? It was a good game at first but now I‚Äôm starting to see that a lot of the levels have changed. I‚Äôm so stuck on this one level I‚Äôm about to delete the whole app I‚Äôm so annoyed. I went to YouTube(Suzy) looking for help only to see that the moves have been reduced? Why? Why do y‚Äôall do that? No matter how many boosters I use I just can break through level 1725. Suzy had 25 moves to clear the bored and I only get 19 with 118 jellies to clear. It‚Äôs freakin impossible! I‚Äôve bought boosters which was a freaking waste and I still can‚Äôt beat it. Fix it!
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,You‚Äôll love the challenges
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,Good game good games
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,2,"Timed bombs all at the bottom, seriously wasted enough time with this. Really pushing the $$$. Not about to do that.  I have to wait to even play? What a racket."
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,"Game is stuck and will not open. I don‚Äôt want to loose my level. Disappointed and hopeful for a quick fix. Can I get a refund on my last purchase!
Thank you. I want to continue to play."
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,3,"I love a challenging arcade game in this game seemed to be just the thing . However, when the game levels become so hard that they feel impossible, it stops being fun. I have really enjoyed playing this game as a way to relax during the pandemic, but I t‚Äôs not relaxing anymore either. All it is is frustrating. I am not a person who uses cheats but have spent multiple bonuses trying to crack one of the higher levels with no success. I‚Äôm done. There‚Äôs enough frustration in the world right now without my ‚Äúrelaxing‚Äù game causing it."
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,For heavens sake....it‚Äôs a game!  I‚Äôve played to level 3997!  I‚Äôm sick of your manipulation of your players.  Getting them to spend money on imaginary extra spins...bye bye.  Not fun anymore
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,Since it‚Äôs been updated it won‚Äôt let me play. Keeps saying loading.
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,4,"In level 7972, how can I get 4 frogs? What is mean by that?"
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,Since the last update I can not go on and play this game. It‚Äôs been about a couple of weeks already. Can someone do another update to fix this problem. It‚Äôs frustrating and I‚Äôm about to delete this game.
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,3,Fun but expensive!
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,Absolutely the WORST!  Impossible to solve üò°
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,"Dang piggy bank still takes minutes to ‚Äúcount my bars‚Äù, even though it‚Äôs been telling me evert five minutes exactly how many there are!"
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,"Reached 681 level, 
One suggestion please,
I like to watch more ads videos to win the prizes .
In this version there is no ads to watch and get prizes .
Thanks üôè"
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,I love this game I could play all day
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,"I used to love this game, played daily on it. All of a sudden, I cannot see the friends that used to be with me. So l can‚Äôt see their progress, or requests lives. I felt I was playing alone. Stopped playing it."
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,"I took a long break from candy crush because it began to frustrate me so much. Well, I just started playing again, and it seems they updated it to take away any chance of winning gold bars rather than outright buying them. Now you just win boosters in the race. And I haven‚Äôt been given the option a single time to watch an ad or spin the wheel for extra moves. Trying to force people to buy gold bars in order to have more moves. This kind of thing is exactly what made me stop playing in the first place. I get they want to make money, but to take away ALL options from people who don‚Äôt want to spend it is just wrong and makes people not want to play any more."
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,2,I played this game for 5 years and then it froze. I tried everything to get it to in freeze. Nothing worked. I lost 5 years progress. I was up to level 3100 something.  I am not happy!!!!
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,3,"I‚Äôve noticed an increased number of game glitches that have significantly impacted my ability to win. I‚Äôve had stripe/wrapped candy combo‚Äôs skip rows/columns, the candy frog has not recognized when there is match, told I didn‚Äôt have enough points for a target game when I did. 

They also removed gold bars from the fast race which makes me less inclined to play. I‚Äôve been playing candy crush for a long time but this is my first experience with so many glitches with no opportunity to win gold bars. 
Reconsider fast race gold bars and work to improve the game glitches that prevent users from winning. After so many it feels intentional"
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,4,Fun but expensive to keep playing.
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,Good Game

candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,5,"This is my favorite game ever .I‚Äôm on level 4344 
I play every day. All day. They give gifts all the time . Thank you for candy crush."
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,4,"I love Candy Crush Saga! It is so much fun! Obviously no game is perfect so here is what I like and don‚Äôt like about this game

Pros:
1. Time killer. If your bored playing Candy Crush Saga will keep you occupied for hours!
2. It requires thinking. A lot of games are not challenging. I think when you play a game you should have some type of challenge, and this game definitely has some challenges.

Cons:
1. Sometimes the game crashes. Everybody using the internet can make your games slower, but sometimes this game would just crash on me.
2. Making you pay for things? Basically Candy Crush makes it so to make the game easier and more fun you have to buy things. 

3. Ads. There‚Äôs so many. Omg.

Overall I love Candy crush! And would I recommend downloading it? I can really say, because everyone has a different level of patience and some people don‚Äôt like brain games. And so I would say it‚Äôs up to you!"
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,I‚Äôm on level 1052. I am required to e pop 10 firecrackers. The game does not count all the firecrackers when they pop. I updated the game today and it‚Äôs not fixed. Can you help?

candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,"I like the game, but now that I have iOS 14 I‚Äôm aware that Candy Crush is constantly reading my clipboard. Why??? There‚Äôs absolutely no logical reason. It isn‚Äôt a text messaging app and there‚Äôs no ‚Äútyping‚Äù or writing involved. Very concerning."
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,"Updated the app yesterday. Won't get past the load screen since. First world problems, clearly, but frustrating when the game has been a pleasant occasional escape."

candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,Sorry this was a fun game but the owners have ruined it with constant advertisements.  If you don‚Äôt mind spending 1/2 of your gaming time watching endless advertisements you‚Äôll be fine.  The invasive online tracking is noted in the apps store.   Moving on.
candycrush,us,1.196.0.1,1,I haven‚Äôt been able to play for 2 weeks.  When I start the app it stays stuck on the intro page.  Can‚Äôt add it back in my screen for some reason. I need it deleted but can‚Äôt figure it out

Yeah, swell job with this one."

candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,4,I love candy crush. I can‚Äôt open my app past the loading page. I don‚Äôt want to loose my progress and I‚Äôm over 3000 levels. I changed my Facebook page when I got a new phone because I couldn‚Äôt remember password. I don‚Äôt wAnt to delete it and loose my progress please help
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,4,I will say it is a really fun game. Accept whenever I go in it will not fill my lives. This has not happened since January. So nothing siureuse. I would not give this to a child under three. It is really addicting so be careful. I don‚Äôt buy anything of corse. It is really good for your brain. It makes you think. And anyway if you child bought anything the only thing that is really expensive is a 1000 dollar thing
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,3,Used to be able to spin to get an extra 3-5 moves at the end of the losing level... haven‚Äôt done that in a couple of weeks. Why not?
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,I haven‚Äôt been able to access the game for about a week or so.  I have all the updates.  When I hit the app it shows Loading.... then just goes back to my phones home page.

candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,3,"Is a great game, helps time pass and all of that. I have played for a bit but what keeps happening is that the game would lag or slow down and I would tap the screen then the pay with gold to continue thing would show up and I would buy something that I wouldn‚Äôt want to buy at that moment. It starts to stack up after a while and it turns from mildly annoying to bothersome. Idk I don‚Äôt have an idea how to solve this maybe show the sign to spend more when they try to reopen the lv but this is just a suggestion. Overall review is that the game is pretty fun but has some Annoying parts."

This game can be so enjoyable and just what‚Äôs needed to let your mind relax. But it can also be equally just as stressful when you play 20 or so rounds in a row without ever being given even a chance to win, no matter how well you play, simply bc you haven‚Äôt purchased their overpriced cheats. Sadly, I will likely be uninstalling this digital past time of mine in the very near future, as I don‚Äôt see King changing their money-making scheme anytime soon. There are plenty of free alternative apps that don‚Äôt require purchase to be able to compete fairly."
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,"Was REALLY enjoying this game until suddenly, right after I treated myself to an in game purchase, ALL of my free power-ups disappeared. A coincidence? I don‚Äôt think so? I have tried all the steps listed in the forum to make sure my game is updated, but nothing has changed. It‚Äôs no fun anymore, since there is no way to win without power-ups. Guess I‚Äôll need to find a new game."
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,Completed all levels. Waiting for new levels to be added.
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,I‚Äôm really enjoying this game.

I would love to have the goodie bags, Robot ü§ñ,

It‚Äôs hard to win a Level with no helps. Please take this in consideration.
I play all the time - I hate when I have to stop playing it‚Äôs so frustrating when you can‚Äôt finish, have to wait- and do on.
Thank You"
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,I‚Äôve been playing this game for about week and I love it I‚Äôve been playing so much that I‚Äôm on level 37 I‚Äôm so glad I got this game
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,"I understand that games need to make money to continue developing better games and updates. That being said this game takes it just a little to far, akin to those A**holes that call about your cars extended warranty. Plan on HAVING to spend money more often the higher levels you go..."

candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,Not able to get in the game since Friday
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,Stuck on opening screen and won‚Äôt load. I‚Äôm near level 5500... don‚Äôt want to lose everything!
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,How can you beat a level if the key to unlock things never drop?
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,3,With this pandemic and all the crazy that has gone on in my life this last year I have to give credit to this game because it has been quite helpful just to take the tension off and let go of so much insanity from the election to the pandemic to life‚Äôs ups and downs medical problems. Just limit yourself it gets wild. Games over when you run out of life LOL have fun all.
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,2,I have enjoyed playing the game all the way to level 1274. I have been stuck on that level for over a month! I now just give it one try per day. It is ridiculous that there is no way to skip a level after hundreds of attempts! Ready to uninstall!
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,"I was given the option a long while back to sign in and save progress with my email, Facebook, or Apple. I chose Apple. I go back into my game and my progress is gone...even after signing back into Apple. What a stupid waste. Have fun playing...until you‚Äôre suddenly back at level 1 anyway."
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,3,The game takes my lives that friends send me. If i clock to get 3 lives only one goes through
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,I love this game
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,3,Good game don‚Äôt get me wrong but once you get past a certain level they begin attempting to make you think you‚Äôre getting free benefits but end up trying to get you to pay for boosts like markers that let you know you‚Äôve reached a milestone then tell you to spend money to get boosts. Also they start implementing creative yet more ways to get you to spend money like this popcorn block which can only be broken through special candys and special candys only. Good game and challenging and is for sure beatable without spending a dime but it‚Äôs seems very forced on how hard they‚Äôre attempting to get you to spend money
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,Ok
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,"stop sending adds, i just came from hole io and you guys are already sending broken adds and then i can‚Äôt get out of them.ü§¢ü§Æüë∫üëπüôÑüò°ü§´"
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,3,This game wastes my time. The only reason I play it is to pass my time. I get stuck on ‚Äúeasy‚Äù levels and it takes me about a day to be them. I get I may just be dumb but that‚Äôs not it. I was just playing and the game was literally no help. I lost all of my moves because the game is trash. I‚Äôm about to delete it off my phone if this keeps happening.
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,This game is the worst do not download the game
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,"I recently started playing candy crush again and I got to almost level 300 today. I ran out of lives so I closed out of the game, and when I went back to play again, I was back to level 1...how does this even happen???
Update: I played again and got to about level 100 and it deleted it all again. Never playing this again"
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,Too many problems. Will not let open   Been going on for a while now with no fixes. None of the candy crush games with load. Managers don‚Äôt seem to care
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,Games moving fast. Some of the ads between games will not go away when you touch theX so I just have to walk away.  Really bothersome. Prime video is the worst.
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,4,I love Candycrush
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,4,"I was playing another game but when I saw the candy crush ads I saw that the ad had two candy bombs and I saw it say ‚Äúdownload now‚Äù I knew that it never happens because one time I know what happened because I matched two candy bomb but it did not do it like the ad and instead it clears the board one by one, so I recommend to stop putting the add because it kin da annoys me.

(Otherwise candy crush is the best)"
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,3,"My mom and I both play this game quite often on both iPhones and iPads. Throughout the years, we‚Äôve noticed this game changes the ways to win free boosters/gold bars quite often. We were both very frustrated when the new updates remove free booster videos from her account but not mine. Sometimes, my account also gets certain events that she doesn‚Äôt get and Vice versa. Most recently, my mom updated the app and the prizes for the Fast Race changed from gold bars to boosters. She was extremely upset because this is the only way to earn free gold bars in the app and it‚Äôs the main reason she wants to play so much. She‚Äôs considering deleting the app, while on my version I can still earn gold bars from the race. I understand the app is free to play but removing the opportunity to win free gold bars makes the game a lot less fun. Having consistently across platforms and accounts would also be a huge game changer."
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,3,My game is froze. And will not go past the loading screen. It has been this way for two days. Please fix.
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,2,"Looks like you‚Äôre trying to force us to buy from you.  You‚Äôve taken away the treat calendar and the free spin at the end of a level every 48 hours.  I gotta tell you, this won‚Äôt make me shop with you.  It will make me stop playing your game and move on to something else that‚Äôs more fun."
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,The flashing Tips feature is ANNOYING!
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,"I played for years; even got into the high 3700‚Äôs level. My phone was hacked, so I got to start from scratch. It‚Äôs entirely different and FUN (so far)."

candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,I love this game!!!
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,3,On a few levels the game cheated and made me complete a level twice and a couple of times it didn‚Äôt bust a candy or a jelly properly. I was charged twice a couple of times as well. One time I got fed up with the cheating I deleted the app and if it keeps on doing it I going to get rid of it for good.
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,I‚Äôve tried throughout the day and it won‚Äôt load. I tried opening it several times after shutting down my phone.

candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,2,"I‚Äôm frustrated by this game‚Äôs seemingly random assignations of ‚Äúhard, very hard, and nightmarishly hard levels‚Äù. Some of the allegedly ‚Äúnormal‚Äù levels are impossible to clear without succumbing to the allure of purchasing something from their shop such as infinite lives, etc... I will NOT purchase anything. After playing for several months and experiencing success at ‚Äúswiping the stress away,‚Äù I will now be divorcing myself from this game because it has become unpleasant. Forcing people into making purchases just to see if they can beat ridiculously hard parameters for play is not the same as challenging them with a puzzle."
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,"This game is so much fun, but there is a point you reach where it tells you to come back and gives you a certain time frame. Why?!? You should be able to continue to play and not have to wait. What I end up doing is delete the app, reload it, and start from scratch. Dumb, dumb, dumb! With the way technology is, there should be absolutely no reason why this should happen. This is my only complaint. Hope you fix this dumb, unnecessary error. Thanks!!!"
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,This game is rigged. I just lost a level that I was about to pass because of ‚Äúno more possible combinations/moves‚Äù when there clearly were!

candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,3,"I love this game, but I have been trying to play for a little over week and when I go to the main screen it just sits there and won‚Äôt let me go any further. I hate to uninstall it and then reinstall it and lose all my level completed. Please advise."
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,"If there is one thing I despise more than candy crush, it is the constant candy crush ads.  I just don‚Äôt like or want that game.  Thanks"
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,Been playing the game for years......and it‚Äôs still fun
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,3,"It‚Äôs a fun and well made matching game, and I remember back in the day blasting through levels for hours, but the number of micro transactions and ads in this game is nauseating. Many of the levels in the middle of the ‚Äúrace‚Äù events are near-impassable unless you buy or have won power ups (can be done, just takes a lot of time and luck), and many of the hard levels force you to use any power ups you‚Äôve elected to start with as soon as the puzzle starts, wasting them."
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,It is a very good game and it will take your stress away üòä
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,4,"You guys should start paying us it‚Äôs not easy this game is not easy and I‚Äôm in level 2000, my sister level 3000, this game is fun and very cool,but you guys should start paying us 1 dollar on each level starting from level 500 it‚Äôs not easy naüò´üòÇ"
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,"I have been playing for over 8 years, and the game has been getting harder and they won‚Äôt let you ask for lives anymore! It was my favorite pass time to relax. But not anymore. üò¢ It is sad"

candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,"1. This game use to be alright that‚Äôs why I gave it one star. You use to be able to earn the helping candies to pas levels. Now you have to make a purchase or wait 24 hours for a simple candy. 
2. The levels are unbeatable, you cannot pass a level unless you have the helping candies. You only get one a day from the spin or the daily check in. If you don‚Äôt purchase the helping candy you‚Äôll be stuck on a level for days. 
3. I hate this game and I‚Äôll definitely never play it again."
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,Good
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,"Tell them they have ruined it and it no darn fun Anymore.  The are greedy during a time we need help. This game used to be relaxing.I never can pass levels anymore. I am lucky to get 3 levels a week. They give you some boosters but not like they used to. And the darn boosters half the time don‚Äôt help. They cut the number of moves you get on half the levels. They just want you to pay for this game.  I have never spent a penny on this game. I am fairly far into it. 

I swear there is an Algorithm.  I‚Äôll play a hard level and won‚Äôt pass it for ever then all of a sudden I get exactly what I need without boosters and moves left over.  It‚Äôs BaloneyÔøº."
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,"I enjoy this game but, since recent updates I ‚Äúcan‚Äôt connect to the App Store.‚Äù What to do? I can play the game but no rewards..."
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,3,You ruined the game after level 1000 why?!!!!?
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,Fun game to play!!üëç
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,4,This game is fun and addicting but when you get to the upper levels. It seems the only way to clear the candies is to use all the helps so it can get expensive.
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,3,Recently there‚Äôs a glitch that is not allowing me to revive my life gifts from other players. Every time I click on the mail a different box comes up. Please fix.
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,"I‚Äôve played Candy Crush on and off for a few years now. From my perspective of things, complaints/suggestions by other reviewers have since been fixed. 

In the past, the only way to get gold bars was to pay. If you didn‚Äôt have gold bars, you couldn‚Äôt buy boosters at will, and would have to deal all the cards dealt, even if they were virtually impossible without boosters if you needed a certain kind but didn‚Äôt have them. This would personally result in me not playing for weeks, as well as only having a total of five gold bars in the span of three years. However, you can now get gold bars depending on how fast you complete groupings of levels, and whether you did it above or below the average speed of other players. It helps gameplay very much and speeds it up, so to speak. 

Additionally, just a year or two ago Candy Crush added milestones. These give out small bundles of awards which include a restoration of health, discounted bundles you can buy, etc. I just reached level 1,000 and was pleasantly surprised with what would otherwise be known as a mini ‚Äòjackpot‚Äô without having to spin the prize wheel. I also love the mini events and challenges: the mini storylines, booster-rewards,..

Overall, Candy Crush is a great, aesthetically pleasing game. It‚Äôs not necessarily as addictive as more recent games due to less surprises and suspense, but I can‚Äôt imagine Candy Crush with any suspense at all. I love Candy Crush, as Candy Crush. I look forward to playing a lot more in the future."
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,2,"Why is it always the fun bonuses that get removed first? This was not only a great way to get extra boosters, it was interesting to try to avoid the empty candies! I believe it should be put back in. With that as a means of adding boosters so I could play longer. Enough!"
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,"For the past three days, I‚Äôve been unable to open this app to play. Any suggestions? Thank you."
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,I have really been enjoying this!
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,Has not been loading for 3 days... I've been more productive but starting to Jones for my CC fix! Please fix!
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,3,"I started playing candy crush long after I heard about it and I quite enjoyed it. I rapidly moved up in the levels before realizing that I could go back to already conquered levels to collect additional sugar drops. Then things changed and you took away the sugar drop system (which I was not the only one upset about). So that sucked. I persevered and continued to rise through the levels, being more aware of the remaining boosters available to me and the few I collected along the way. This past Christmas I got a new phone! As the download from my old phone to my new phone went rather smoothly one of th e few issues that I had was Candy Crush. My other games transferred no problem. Candy Crush? I went from the mid 5,000‚Äôs to ZERO. Level zero. I must admit I‚Äôm not happy."
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,So relaxing I love playing it on my breaks this is definitely one of the best games ever
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,It would be amazing if I could actually play the levels without it being impossible to win without paying for the special items :))))))
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,Makes noise through my speakers when I play. Like a whispy white noise type thing. Went online to see how to fix it and the feed was full of them denying it and blaming it on the persons phone
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,Just stop
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,3,Ever since the update it just says loading.  What is up??????
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,Hi if you are reading this call or text me at (214) 892-6633
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,3,Won‚Äôt let you use tools once you get to a certain level.
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,This game has been getting on my last nerve because every time I get a stripe it won‚Äôt go all the way and that causes me to lose the game even though I had a stripe that would‚Äôve won with the game but it won‚Äôt go all the way down there all the way across which is very frustrating for me because yeah and it keeps stealing my lives so I‚Äôm kind of over it right now thank you bye
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,I didn‚Äôt miss a day once and I were unto 72 days and I had to start over and I am up to forty a I was playing everyday now it want me to start over
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,4,App sits ‚Äúloading‚Äù mode when launched.  Just started happening after the last update. Anyone else having the problem?
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,Number one game to play when you are very very quarantine
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,"Usually my candy crush game loads pretty quickly but today it has been stuck on the ‚Äúloading‚Äù screen with the ‚Äúdid you know?‚Äù blurb on it and never fully opens.  Never had any issue like this before. 

Will happily revise review upon it getting fixed."
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,4,I love this game and spend far too much time playing it however after the ISO update it won‚Äôt load anymore :(  I‚Äôve talked to other people and they are having the same problem. Please fix it!
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,4,I love this game but 5 lives at a time really stinks. Can‚Äôt you guys do a half an hour unlimited lives daily like you do on soda saga?
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,This is the second time in as many weeks I‚Äôve had to uninstall and reinstall the app.
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,I love this game i just wish there were more lives so i could play longer üòÇ
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,"I‚Äôm on level 8623.  So you can tell I really enjoy this game.  However a few days ago, it tells me it can‚Äôt connect and to wait a bit.  I‚Äôve now waited 3 days and no difference.  I‚Äôve no problems with other games and apps, just candy crush.  
The bad part is there is no way to email them with problem to get it resolved.  Guess I can‚Äôt play it anymore."
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,As if the game wasn‚Äôt hard enough...you guys get rid of the one wheel that can give us extra moves !!!!!stop being so greedy!!!! I‚Äôve played for years but that did it üò°ü§¨

candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"I bought the piggy bank because I wasn't able to collect more gold, or spend more than the ten bars I began with without it, the moment I bought it the game stopped giving me gold bars don't waste your 3 bucks"
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,"App hasn‚Äôt been working for a few days. Won‚Äôt load past the initial screen, even after the most recent update"
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,The game keeps not working. It wont load and the play button disappears. Every time it updates this happens and have to delete and redownload the app to make it work.
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,4,"I noticed that when the game has ‚Äúno possible matches‚Äù it reshuffles, but after a second reshuffle and there are still no matches it makes you give up/takes away one heart. I just don‚Äôt really see why it has to take away a heart?"
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,I love this app but when u can‚Äôt find a match literally one second later it hilights a match and I hate that bc I want to find it on my own
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,4,My Candy crush saga has not been working for 24 hours does not open is there a problem
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,3,"I believe this level is impossible.  Been on it for at least 2 weeks!  What can I do, besides buying things?"
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,I have been stuck on the loading screen for 2 days now. This is a nightmare!
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,I have problem  I had 600 plus lives and was on level1136  now it tells me I have to start over ! Something is wrong I worked hard and spent a lot of money !  I‚Äôm at same level on my I pad ! Only had more lives on my iPhone
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,I LOVE this game but have been unable to load on my iPhone 11 for the past week. Please fix this app... thanks.
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,5,Awesome and fun
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,4,Frozen for three days!
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,"While playing the game it got stuck loading a new board, so I closed the App. When I click App to play it attempts to load then close. This has been happening for 2 weeks since the previous update. I just installed the new update and it is still not loading. Please fix this."
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,2,I‚Äôve had candy crush for years and I went to update it recently and it froze my phone. Very sad to have to delete app!
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,This game is overrated.
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,3,It will not let me log into my face book account. Idk why but it will save my photo and my name but not my progress. Idk what to do. It is a fun game with challenging levels that are difficult but not too difficult. All I have is that one big problem that it will not save any of my progress.
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,"Rip Off , I lost over 100 lives over night just gone next day, 
Today it happened again this time 50, and guess what   Support does not care. 
Do not down load...................

This time the game locked up and couldn‚Äôt play, so I deleted the app to reload it, now I have to start all over again.

I have done this in other apps and I started where I left off.

Where is the help......................."
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,1,This game is very boring
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,2,After years on iOS and literally billions of dollars for the developer they still haven‚Äôt been able to get this basic puzzle game with minimum graphics requirements to stop constantly pausing and jittering during game play. At this point it‚Äôs obvious that this problem will never be fixed.
candycrush,us,1.195.1.1,2,"This is the 2nd time I have NOTICED this and who knows, possibly it‚Äôs happened way more and I just never payed that close of attention. I had about 4 moves left and decided I needed a lollipop hammer thingy majig and so I purchased the $5.99 package that included ‚Äúlollipop hammers‚Äù (I have and do spend wayyy more than I should in this game and I am usually ok with that, so don‚Äôt let this amount I just mentioned make anyone disregard this comment) anyway, and a few other rando‚Äôs AND 20 GOLD BARS!!! Did I receive the gold bars?!?! NOPE...not even 1!! I wasn't out of lives, I didn't need or have to use any gold bars to continue this level therefore it should have added on to what I already had!!! I only had 8 bars to begin this particular level so I clearly remember how many I had. So...I was ripped off from receiving them! It is also why I bought that particular package to add a few extra bars just to have in hand. I have noticed this one other time and figured I just saw wrong but I payed extra close attention this time to make sure I am getting what I paid for as like I said it happened before. Why King/Candy Crush do you think you need to pull fast ones on all your devoted players. Yes, I choose to spend the cash and no one forces one to spend, but give what is purchased fully please! It is not so much about the money or else I wouldn‚Äôt even purchase to begin with. But come on! You guys are doing well...no need to rip off the devoted and the spenders. Also, the one and only other time I have ever commented, I noticed this too, my comment was never published and present...why? Because of the truth? Again...just be fair is all I and probably thousands or more others who spend the dough only ask for. No extra benefits or privileges just fairness in getting what we purchase. Thank you! Please make this comment visible to all. Happy crushing to the rest of you crushers!"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,This game isn‚Äôt not fun i was on level 2400 and when I upgraded my phone the game didn‚Äôt transfer had to start from scratch what a disappointment
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,3,Great puzzle game & excellent rewards throughout the game.  Anybody else having troubles loading or playing this game for the past week?  I‚Äôve tried to load game & it gets stuck on pre-opening screen.  Why?

candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"This game gets you sucked into playing it so long that you get to a point you can no longer win without paying for power ups. The software script is rigged to give you candies that don‚Äôt match way later in the game (past level 100)so you have to use bought/paid for power ups or lose all winning streak prizes.. unless you pay them for power ups. No thank you.
Scam."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,The new graphics are very hard to look at.  The new spiral squares (I‚Äôm not sure what they‚Äôre replacing) have red sections the same color as red candies.  Some of the levels are an optical illusion to look at now.  Also why are there no more noticeable graphics when you crush a striped or taped candy???

candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"With every update it just gets more and more ridiculous: less moves on levels, occasional free spins for extra moves removed.. the current level I'm on has 8 moves to clear SEVENTY-FOUR jellies, which also happens to require four keys (that are in cages) to unlock. How is that even possible without a ""lucky board""? Zero skill is required, it's all luck (unless you spend money to pass levels, which I refuse to do).  I haven't deleted because I have a small bit of hope that with all of the complaints it will trend better again."

Ok so, Is this a new game? I think it was made in 2019, or 2020 or 2021. I don‚Äôt know....

Maybe people started not doing anymore reviews and just started beating the game and playing it and not being so lazy and making reviewsü§≠

That‚Äôs all for now....

It‚Äôs 12 am in my country, I woke up litarelly at 6 in the morning. And was waiting for my screen time to go off and it finally become 7 AM!"

candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,2,I love Candy Crush but for the past couple of weeks I‚Äôve been getting requests from a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù for lives.  I have no way to deny it or block it.  This person sends requests several times a day.  It is annoying and I am not connected with Facebook.  This issue needs to be fixed ASAP.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,This is an awesome game that I really enjoy playing.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,2,Anybody else notice that every time you open this game there is a pretty loud static noise that comes from the phone speaker? I‚Äôm not sure what that is but when I close the app the noise stops. Is the deliver recording something? I‚Äôm kind of confused
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,3,I have been playing this game for over than 12 years and I love it.but now I can‚Äôt any more I try to open it y this close immediately.I don‚Äôt know what to do.

candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"Updated:  App will no longer load.  

Updated 10/11/18. No longer able to keep helmets?  Ridiculous.  The 3000 levels are difficult enough without taking what I earned away!!  Oh, and are you making up all those one word five star rating-sad and hilarious. One literally says ‚Äúawe‚Äù with a Title of ‚ÄúAwesome‚Äù"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,Playing game for a while. Shows rewards but never receive. Done with this game!!  It is not what they presented in their description.

candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,I see so many adds for this game its unreal. The adds don‚Äôt even have real gameplay and their very bad. If I see one more add for this game I swear to gosh i will be VERY VERY MAD.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"Like others have said, if you want to throw your money at it, this game is enjoyable, but after changes, the only way to win some levels is to give them your money. Was fun, but due to this change, may be time to say bye bye to candy crush."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,i cannot get my game back  i am on level 1250+ now i want to start from 0 zero
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,2,"Hundreds of us have reported that the app won‚Äôt load, but I see no response from the app developers. A simple ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a known bug and we are working on a fix‚Äù would go a long way."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"Ever since I updated my phone, the app won‚Äôt load. HELP!"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"It was fun to play until recently when it stopped loading. Fix the problem, please!"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Sweet
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,why take away the free spin?? i want to stop playing this game more and more everyday
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"Every time I click candy crush it just sticks on the loading screen. I‚Äôve spent way too much money on this game to be treated like this üò≠ü§£ It‚Äôs up to date, and my husband just sits on the couch swiping away while I can‚Äôt even load it. HELP!!!"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,4,"Hey Candy Crush,
Please quit taking my plays away. Today I had over 1000+, and the game has taken away over 300+.
üó£WHY?"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"App has crashed last week with the new update. Not able to load the app even after restarting the phone several times.  This is the primary device I have played candy crush on for several years and accumulated a lot of boosters.   I will lose them if I delete and reinstall.   All my other apps work on this device.   With all the money that King games makes with ads and charging for boosters etc, why can‚Äôt they fix this issue?   Feel cheated."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,The game is now horrible. Can‚Äôt pass. Need real money to beat some levels. And the worse is no matter where I am there are freaking commercials for this mess. A little to much! An makes me not want to play. Just take it down a freaking notch! My God ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,I love very much
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,I LOVE THIS GAME BUT THE HEARTS INSTEAD OF FLOWERS IS TERRIBLE. PURPLE HEARTS DONT FIT THE GAME ITS A NO
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,I stopped playing years ago    I‚Äôm glad it popped up on a different game I was playing
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,2,Since the update I have not been able to get in the game.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"Since the update, I was unable to open app. Had to delete it, lose lives and now won‚Äôt download"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,"My game won‚Äôt open. Gets to the first screen and shuts off!!
I was on level 3613 or 14 and I don‚Äôt want to reset"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,"The game it‚Äôs really good I reallly really like it I won‚Äôt be uninstalling it any time soon you guys should download it, it would be nice if u guys could give us more moves tho.."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,I am trying to play Solitaire and this ad came up and I cannot get to Solitaire. I don‚Äôt mind the advertising but this is offensive.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,"Can‚Äôt get candy crush sage on my iPhone since last Friday Jan. 29th, 2021 I can get all my other Candy Crush games but not Saga wondering why ? Anyone else having this problem?? Thanks"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,It‚Äôs awesome!!
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Love the game but I want to know where my golf go when I won some gold
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"Like others have reported, the game won‚Äôt load in iOS 14.4 ever since last week‚Äôs game update. It‚Äôs just stuck on the opening splash screen. I‚Äôm not going to delete and reinstall because then I‚Äôll lose everything I had saved. You‚Äôre losing money from me ‚Äî which is your problem, not mine. Maybe this is a good way to end my addiction."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Love the game except when it says no moves but you see several more.  Frustrating. Not fair.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Awesome
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,3,Don‚Äôt update. My app won‚Äôt open but I love the game
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,What‚Äôs going on ? The app is not opening ?
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Love this game!
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,4,"the brainpower involved is minimal, you‚Äôre just sitting and watching things happen 95% of the time, and yet it‚Äôs still fun in a mindless way which i can never really understand.   i wish i knew exactly what ‚Äòrat in the skinner box‚Äô lobe of my brain is getting tickled when i play a ‚Äògame‚Äô like this, but it‚Äôs all good.  i even buy stuff once in a blue moon! i suspect that once the heavier gacha aspects present i‚Äôll get irked and walk away but for now, it‚Äôs fun.  i wish you guys could come up with at least three songs that would loop, though.  that tune gets rough after a while isksksksk!  thanks for a weirdly relaxing experience although i haven‚Äôt a clue as to why it‚Äôs relaxing, cheaper than calm, too.  üåüüåàüåü"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,"Awesome, too addicting!"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,4,I think when you WIN gold bars you shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for them !!!
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"I‚Äôve been playing Candy crush for years. I have never hated this game more until now,  I have been having so many issues and ever single time I contacted king they seem so nonchalant like they don‚Äôt even care. Or They just ignore your email to them and  don‚Äôt even get back with you. My game show I clear 5000 on January 7 I was like hmmm.. maybe it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm doing so I login out of my Facebook and login back in after seeing that didn‚Äôt work I powered  off my phone after seeing that didn‚Äôt work I was all ready mad at this point so I just stop playing for a day or two and when I so call achieved 5000 cleared level my friends can see that when they go to the leader bored I was all ready on level 5758 so how it was saying I clear 5000 level. Then on January 26 it was showing I. Achieved 5000 level cleared agin and I was all ready on level 6117 so it was showing I clear 500 level so I contact king support no freaking help at all they just say the same bull over and over not fixing my problem. So I tryed to login in login out and power off and power back on and open my game. NOW it‚Äôs showing I achieve/cleared 6097 level at this point I was Beyond mad and it was show I clear 6097 when I didn‚Äôt.  I stop playing candy crush and I stop off at level 5144 last year in MAY  is when I picked up my phone and played a few level is cleared them. Then I stop playing agin I stopped playing for like 6/7 months then at the ending of October I started back playing that was October 28 2020. And now I come back playing this game and it‚Äôs having all these glitches or whatever the heck you want to call it. I‚Äôm about to quit playing if king don‚Äôt fix all these glitches it‚Äôs so aggravating and I‚Äôm sick and tried of going back and forth with the king customer service via email., I‚Äôve love playing but all the glitches is ridiculous. Oh and second I can‚Äôt see all my friends who play candy crush on the map on nothing and I know they complete the level can‚Äôt see all my friends playing the game. I‚Äôm so fed up at this point."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"I‚Äôm on level 4229 and like others, I used to enjoy this game.  It was challenging, but I was able to advance.  This was due to free spins, rewards for completing levels, the ability to restart games without losing lives and many other ways to get help.  It has now become a game that is impossible to advance without spending money, which I refuse to do.  Eventually, after many days on one level, the game will take pity and setup a no fail board and you can advance one level, which you will be at for weeks.
I‚Äôm assuming the game has been rewritten to force people to spend money if you want to win levels, so if you don‚Äôt mind handing over the cash, you‚Äôll probably enjoy this game.  I no longer do."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,It says I have no connection but my internet is working fine?? Worst game ever. Penis.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"Esta verga es solo para pasarlo con dinero, no vale la pena. Llevo estancado en una parte desde ayer y es una parte no tan distante..."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,2,"Needs a new update I think. Keeps
quitting for a couple days now. Wont open."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Great App
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,This game isnt about skill. It is about soending money to advance through the game.  There are points along the way that you absolutely can‚Äôt move on without buying something.  I deleted after spending money and at one point refusing to spend money and getting stuck on one level. In the end it is about paying them to let you win. Don‚Äôt waste your time.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,Still can‚Äôt open after moment recent update. Just ‚Äúloading‚Äù screen
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,Started me all over when I was in the high 3000.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,It‚Äôs good  Even though this game is amazing it‚Äôs still ripped off another game. Please give tribute to that came in the future.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,New update is awful!!! It will not let me on... Deleted the app and tried to start over and now it won't let me log on through Facebook!!! Please fix.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,It stopped loading like 3 days ago
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,DO YOU KNOW WHY I AM NOT ABLE TO SEE WHAT LEVEL EVERYONE IS ON DO YOU KNOW HOW TO FIX THAT? LOVE JOHN
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"App keeps crashing; I had lots of boosters stored up and now they‚Äôre gone because I had to reinstall the app......which, by the way, is still crashing"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,It‚Äôs exciting
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,It‚Äôs only chill if you buy the extras. Otherwise some of the levels are literally impossible to beat.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,3,I won its Amazing üòÉüòÉ üòÉ ty thats was SO COOOOOOOOOOLL
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,2,Love the game there seems to be some bugs my race disappeared after the new update. I‚Äôm starting to wonder if the races are permanently gone. It‚Äôs the only thing that keeps me playing consistently.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,I really enjoy playing CC but my original game locked up on me in the loading stage. There was no way to unlock. Very disappointed. I was up in the 5200 area. Had to start over
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,Worst game ever
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Play every night just to have my time for me!
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Great
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,I love this gane
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,Why do the mountains in the ads look like the underside of a penis?
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,I love this appüòç me and my mom always play this game great gam
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Amazing
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"New update happened and now, it stays on the loading screen. I shut my phone down and still nothing.."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,Hola Buenos d√≠as el app no me abre le agradecer√≠a cualquier ayuda . Gracias
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,Says it‚Äôs loading but it doesn‚Äôt.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"The game don‚Äôt load for me abd I can‚Äôt play anymore and it always come with an error that says no internet connection but my internet is working and the game also don‚Äôt give me game prizes
I think it is a bug that the developers should fix it 
Please answer my review and fix the game
Have a good day
Bye:D"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,3,It started to get boring in 3 hours
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,Game quit working! Won‚Äôt load for two days now!
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,Irritating Advertisement
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Candy crush is nice because it let‚Äôs children play and it‚Äôs a lot fun
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,2,The design is pretty but the UX is terrible and unusable. The font is also pretty but very hard to read in the 2 seconds you‚Äôre given to read it. And so many times the app does not behave as would be expected.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"This game design to make you purchase more and more because some level on the way are designed specially to made you buy candy to pas, overall DO NOT SPEND A CENT ON THIS GAME!!"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,Updates recently have ruined the ability to buy boosters. Constant error message saying no connection won‚Äôt allow it to connect to my account or to buy anything. I‚Äôve emailed and got NO response after I‚Äôve explained in detail the issue. Don‚Äôt waste your time or money here
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,3,Please give instructions when a new item or new term or symbol is in the game. With no instructions we miss out on a chance to keep our streak. Yall really be cheating making the disco balls go off often when it moves when it not the players doing.  Level 775 yall are definitely cheating. Make our special candy explode without the players doing -_-.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,2,Multiple times now When I‚Äôve gotten a daily reward it does not show up when I go to the game. The fact that they don‚Äôt have a way to reach out with issues while in the game as just about all do show they are too big to help the end user I purchased the pack for $5.99 and did not get my 20 bars I also agree with some of the levels being to hard or as they cutely call them nightmarishly hard so that you buy boosters or gold bars hoping you get what you pay for I‚Äôm ready to quit playing at this point.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,I love candy crush!
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Fun and challenging to get to each level hard to stop playing.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"I didn‚Äôt want this game. I still don‚Äôt want it. I‚Äôm angry and giving one star because I was playing an entirely unrelated game, during which an ad for Candy Crush Saga came up as usual. This time though‚Äîwithout me tapping it AT ALL‚Äîit forced me to download the game to exit the ad, and then it didn‚Äôt even exit, it crashed the app entirely. It did its little autoplay fake minigame that it does in every ad, pulled up a mini download screen within the ad that wouldn‚Äôt let me tap out of it and only led to the App Store popup window, which seemed to freeze the 30-second ad countdown X button so it literally never showed up until I hit the download button just to see if it would leave me alone. It downloaded...and then proceeded to crash the app I was originally in, losing all the progress I‚Äôd made on a particular level for the past 15 or so minutes (it was a puzzle game). So no, I don‚Äôt like Candy Crush Saga, and even if I LIKED this genre of game I will never play it, simply because of the absurdity of their ad. That was blackmail and abuse, plain and simple. Will be reporting. Not cool."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,App is not working it is freezing up
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Everyone should try this game
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,2,Taking things away to try and drive revenue never works.  About to give it all up!
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,Game isn‚Äôt loading and I‚Äôve been playing it for years! Is it down?
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,My candy crush game went out it want come back please help me I love this game
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,4,The game stopped working after the last update.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,El juego es de habilidad y desarrollo mental.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,3,"Really like the game for quick brain breaks but now the latest removal of the booster wheel after a timed waiting period is gone. Meaning if you want todo in for 5/15 extra moves, you have to use the bricks.

This seems like a cash grab by King to try and get more people to spend money. 

Not happening."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,I used to love playing this game. I‚Äôve had to start over 2 times already as it kicked me out of the game and started me in the beginning. I‚Äôve tried reaching out to the powers that be in this game but I can‚Äôt get anywhere with them. Sad...I loved this game
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"STOP PUTTING THIS DUMB FREAKING GAMES ADS ON EVERY COMMERCIAL BREAK. KARINA GARCIA AINT PLAY IT, THAT OTHER GIRL PROBABLY DONT PLAY IT. JUST STOP YOU HAVE A TRASH GAME."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Enjoy the gameüòÉDavid
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,I‚Äôve been playing candy crush for years now. This past week they charged my card $120 for gold bars etc when I NEVER clicked on it! What a disappointment I‚Äôm never playing again
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Entretiene mucho
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Suuuper entretenido!!!!
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,4,Game is not opening up! I‚Äôm on my third day of not being able to play. I‚Äôve tried to delete the app to see about load it back up from cloud but it doesn‚Äôt delete!
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"You got a problem with your app and advertisements and other games. It locks you out of other games. Then you got to start all over again because you have to clear it in order to finish playing your game. It needs fixed
One reason I refuse to download the game
And they won‚Äôt let me leave a review cause everything I put in they keep tell me it‚Äôs taken even if it‚Äôs just a row of obscure numbers and letters"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,I grew an obsession with this game. I feel like a white mom playing it and I am not complaining.  It‚Äôs fun and easy to get addicted to. 10/10 !
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Fun fun
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,2,"i love candy crush and have been playing for years but i updated it to the latest version today and it is so hard to look at it is too much and overwhelming. please consider going back to the original/previous appearance, it was classic and timeless"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Candy Crush is the most addictive game ever. I love it. The graphics are fantastic. I‚Äôve even found the music to be almost meditative at times. I couldn‚Äôt survive without this game through this pandemic. It‚Äôs saved my sanity and kept me from going out when I should stay home. My only complaint is that I sometimes have to wait between games after using all my lives. Pure torture.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Great app.!
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"Probably the worst game I have ever played. How this game is built is not for people with high anxiety. The game gives you a certain amount of moves to accomplish each board. However, for the first portion of the moves the game dictates what you do and you accomplish absolutely nothing. Super frustrating!"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Very good so far
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"It‚Äôs a fun game, however, there seems to be so much happening without my doing.  I make one move and things keeping moving and exploding for minutes thereafter.  It‚Äôs annoying."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"I‚Äôve played this game for several years. So addictive that I‚Äôve had to delete it many times!  
However, the latest download has been extremely frustrating. It is stuck on reload at the end of each game, to use the booster wheel, and to get extra turns. I contacted the app maker and evidently this has been a difficult issue that can not be fixed easily. When I check other comments in the support section I learned that this has been an issue for over a year!!! 
I can‚Äôt get any boosters or enter any races. Without boosters, it is impossible to advance. 
Sadly, I have deleted this app again, probably for good"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,This story is about one little girl who started playing a game which is called candy crush she loved it so much and she didn't even like candy even when she started playing candy crush she realize that candy was so good that she started eating it and playing candy crush she loved it so much she did it every day once a week and that's how much time you should eat candy so that little girl from now on play candy crush and eat candy canes and ate candy canes no
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"Getting really tired of having lives sent from other players, and not having them added to my total. Even when I accept them one at a time, sometimes it‚Äôll add it to my total, sometimes not. Also, the game does not seem to be loading completely, the Beanstalk is very rarely there, and there‚Äôs very few times that the second chance wheel comes up. It‚Äôs getting extremely frustrating. I‚Äôve emailed App Support and they were no help. I‚Äôm playing on my iPad and on level 2288 - but I‚Äôm seriously considering finding another game. I guess King is not making enough $$$."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,The new update is very difficult for our eyes!!! Fix it ASAP!!! I might stop playing!!
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,"I love Candy Crush, so I was sad when the levels became too difficult üòû"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"When I saw this game I thought it would be fun so I tried it but I didn‚Äôt really like it, now I keep seeing this crack head fame every time I try to watch a video, I see it over and over and over I don‚Äôt like the new update I hate this game I will never download this again oh and when I downloaded I still saw those ads"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAP TO SKIP RIGHT AFTER YOU WIN THE GAME
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Helps keep this old mind working.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"This game is addicting and fun, but it literally forces you to spend money to play. Do not ever fall for this scam please!"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Meditative
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,4,Fun
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"It gets real boring you just do the same thing over and over and over again at least make different themes and way to customize our avatar 

At least make it worth playing"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,This game is so addicting and awesome! I love it!
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"Not a fan of this game anymore, once you are over level 2,000 the levels difficulties are so high the you have to use a boost or spend several lives on one round due to the lack of available moves. Not interested in this game any longer, wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone not even to pass time along."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,I love this.I always play it!
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"Another way this garbage game cheats is when you run out of hearts. You look to see friends have gifted you 5 hearts. You accept all 5, but only get 2. Hmmm... more cheating huh. Well you try to outsmart them next time. You do 1 heart at a time... nope. Cash in a heart, get natta. Cash in another and get 1 heart. Do this with the remaining 3, and get 1 of them. Total bull$h@&!!! This developer needs to f-up a tree somewhere."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,4,Thanks for the game
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,This game is so satisfying that it's such a good game. It's so fun and calm especially with the music. I definitely recommend downloading this game!!
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"THIS GAME GAVE MY PHONE A VIRUS. I PLAY GAME AND WHEN I LEAVE MESSAGE SAYS YOUR IPHONE WAS INFECTED WITH A VIRUS FROM VISITING THIS APP. There also way TOO MANY ADDS. I HAD TO RESET MY PHONE.

DO NOT GET THIS APP. It may give you the same problem"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"The game is good for killing time but buyer beware. I had accumulated 299 gold and then went to log in with my Facebook and somehow only had 20 gold all of a sudden.

candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"If I buy something I get charged several times! This needs to be fixed! 
Some friends who play get to watch a video for extra moves or help in the game. I‚Äôve never had this:( been playing since this game came out!  I have beaten several levels and came back to play later and have to beat the level again!! So frustrating! Please update and fix the problems! Tired of over paying and losing stuff along with not getting the boosts that are out there!"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,I cannot get my candy crush saga game to stop freezing. It has been doing so for weeks now. I hav to keep deleting the game and then bringing it back. Very frustrating very!!!

candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"But now you‚Äôve taken away the little fun things about Candy Crush...no more second chance wheel? You hardly bring up the little beanstalk guy, gaining boosters and gold bars is impossible.  It‚Äôs sad that a game that was so fun got a lot of the fun sucked out.  Guess it‚Äôs time to find a new game...or just face the negative in the world...the world doesn‚Äôt revolve around candies üëéüèº"

However, when I look to see what apps are running, Candy Crush seems to be one of them. I access it and it goes through the same steps. It starts to load and then disappears. 

I eagerly wait for each update in hopes it would fix the problem. 
Hope you fix this problem soon!
When you do, I will give it 5 stars!"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Really like this game
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,"Love the game , Candy Rush"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,This is by far the best game I have ever played. I would definitely recommend this game to any one who loves a good challenge. Some of the levels are hard and some are easy but all this game was created for was the fun for a good challenge.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Love it!
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,Candy crush will not load on my iphone for the last 3 weeks. I‚Äôm done trying.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,2,"candy crush is a good games yes, but when you start a new level and the candy bounces up and down it‚Äôs really annoying and i can‚Äôt concentrate on the game which is really frustrating and makes me want to slam my phone against the wall and step on it over and over again and run it over with a motorcycle and dip it in concrete."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,So I literally just completed a level and it restarted me for that level.
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,3,It would be awesome if after finishing a level an individual wouldn‚Äôt be bombarded with in-app purchases.
candycrush,us,1.193.0.2,3,The app randomly completely blacks out in the middle of a game. I have to close the app so then I lose a life. Also lucky beans has not worked right the last few times. It doesn‚Äôt give me what I picked.
candycrush,us,1.193.0.2,5,The game is amazing I love to play when I just want to kill time but when I kill time I often also listen to music specially on spodify but when I‚Äôm listening to music on candy crush it crashes my whole spodify and no it‚Äôs not my spodify that only happens on candy crush please try to work on the situation candy crush I love your game
candycrush,us,1.193.0.2,5,IT THE BEST GAME EVER
candycrush,us,1.193.0.2,2,"When the game is over, it‚Äôs over."

candycrush,us,1.193.0.2,2,I‚Äôve had this game on my phone for years. Every once in a while it will get a glitch and kick me out but it‚Äôs always been fixed. Now I tap on the app to open it and it sits on the orange king screen for a second then kicks me out. It‚Äôs been like this for almost a week. If I delete and reinstall the app I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll lose. It wouldn‚Äôt always connect to Facebook.
candycrush,us,1.193.0.2,2,"I have been playing this game for years and I start over frequently. In the new version I cannot get past level 150, 
it‚Äôs just too hard to keep playing when the levels are so 
tough. So I will no longer enjoy playing this game."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,This story is about one little girl who started playing a game which is called candy crush she loved it so much and she didn't even like candy even when she started playing candy crush she realize that candy was so good that she started eating it and playing candy crush she loved it so much she did it every day once a week and that's how much time you should eat candy so that little girl from now on play candy crush and eat candy canes and ate candy canes no
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"Getting really tired of having lives sent from other players, and not having them added to my total. Even when I accept them one at a time, sometimes it‚Äôll add it to my total, sometimes not. Also, the game does not seem to be loading completely, the Beanstalk is very rarely there, and there‚Äôs very few times that the second chance wheel comes up. It‚Äôs getting extremely frustrating. I‚Äôve emailed App Support and they were no help. I‚Äôm playing on my iPad and on level 2288 - but I‚Äôm seriously considering finding another game. I guess King is not making enough $$$."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,The new update is very difficult for our eyes!!! Fix it ASAP!!! I might stop playing!!
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,"I love Candy Crush, so I was sad when the levels became too difficult üòû"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"When I saw this game I thought it would be fun so I tried it but I didn‚Äôt really like it, now I keep seeing this crack head fame every time I try to watch a video, I see it over and over and over I don‚Äôt like the new update I hate this game I will never download this again oh and when I downloaded I still saw those ads"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAP TO SKIP RIGHT AFTER YOU WIN THE GAME

At least make it worth playing"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,This game is so addicting and awesome! I love it!
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"Not a fan of this game anymore, once you are over level 2,000 the levels difficulties are so high the you have to use a boost or spend several lives on one round due to the lack of available moves. Not interested in this game any longer, wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone not even to pass time along."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,I love this.I always play it!
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"Another way this garbage game cheats is when you run out of hearts. You look to see friends have gifted you 5 hearts. You accept all 5, but only get 2. Hmmm... more cheating huh. Well you try to outsmart them next time. You do 1 heart at a time... nope. Cash in a heart, get natta. Cash in another and get 1 heart. Do this with the remaining 3, and get 1 of them. Total bull$h@&!!! This developer needs to f-up a tree somewhere."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,4,Thanks for the game
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,This game is so satisfying that it's such a good game. It's so fun and calm especially with the music. I definitely recommend downloading this game!!
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"THIS GAME GAVE MY PHONE A VIRUS. I PLAY GAME AND WHEN I LEAVE MESSAGE SAYS YOUR IPHONE WAS INFECTED WITH A VIRUS FROM VISITING THIS APP. There also way TOO MANY ADDS. I HAD TO RESET MY PHONE.

DO NOT GET THIS APP. It may give you the same problem"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"The game is good for killing time but buyer beware. I had accumulated 299 gold and then went to log in with my Facebook and somehow only had 20 gold all of a sudden. Reached out to customer support and all they could say was there was no issue on their end and for me to ‚Äúhave a sweet day!‚Äù 

Sorry but I‚Äôm not having a sweet day with this level of customer ‚Äúsupport‚Äù."
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,Some of these levels are futile
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,I progressed to step 2700 but the game kicked me out. Now I want to log in again with my email address but there is a communication problem from the game side
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,It‚Äôs not working
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,3,Not able to play on my phone
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,"This is an amazing game i love it and it is like it never ends that is why I like it so much any one who has not tried it should try it and sign in to king account ,I also like it because ads don‚Äôt interrupt the game while you atmrw playing"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"If I buy something I get charged several times! This needs to be fixed! 
Some friends who play get to watch a video for extra moves or help in the game. I‚Äôve never had this:( been playing since this game came out!  I have beaten several levels and came back to play later and have to beat the level again!! So frustrating! Please update and fix the problems! Tired of over paying and losing stuff along with not getting the boosts that are out there!"
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,I cannot get my candy crush saga game to stop freezing. It has been doing so for weeks now. I hav to keep deleting the game and then bringing it back. Very frustrating very!!!

candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,5,Lol but it was fun those days buyer not Anymore but I give ten for.... idk-
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,To much distracting graphics
candycrush,us,1.194.0.2,1,"But now you‚Äôve taken away the little fun things about Candy Crush...no more second chance wheel? You hardly bring up the little beanstalk guy, gaining boosters and gold bars is impossible.  It‚Äôs sad that a game that was so fun got a lot of the fun sucked out.  Guess it‚Äôs time to find a new game...or just face the negative in the world...the world doesn‚Äôt revolve around candies üëéüèº"

candycrush,ca,1.196.0.1,3,I don‚Äôt like how you guys changed the prized for the races for each section to power ups..gold bars were better. Change it back please
candycrush,ca,1.196.0.1,5,Membro Quit asking for life you make the game depressing
candycrush,ca,1.196.0.1,1,I am not going to spend a single penny for stupid things . There should be choice of collecting bonuses by playing more and more and not just emptying your Wallet on Candy Crush. I used to play this until 2016 and now I installed it in 2021 and all they keep on asking is for to buy stuff.  It‚Äôs not the same candy crush anymore.  I wish I could minus stars or negative rating just because it‚Äôs ke on asking me to make purchases.
candycrush,ca,1.196.0.1,1,Il faut atantdre un 15 m a la con pour se juex de merd
candycrush,ca,1.196.0.1,3,I hate the changes. No need to race to finish the levels now of all you get is a lousy prize instead of gold. And refilling lives is next to impossible and irritating. Not sure if we have to constantly ask for friends to send them but when people send you messages saying you never send me lives makes no sense to me. It seems like a big money grab to me.
candycrush,ca,1.196.0.1,5,Hours of Fun!!!!!!
candycrush,ca,1.196.0.1,4,I do love this game but I'm finding certain adds that I watch to get boosters crash my iPad or after they are complete don't have an x to get back to the game. The Motley Fool add seems to be the worst....

 The Ads are back and so is the game crashes!
Ads make the games CRASH! At least, my games. All Levels can be won without them or spending money on boosters. Be patient!

 I have never spent a cent/pense/etc. on any in-app purchases. That's for suckers and no-body cares or notices if you win or die. Go give your real money to charities instead and play the game for free and with passiveness. The game itself is not important."

candycrush,ca,1.195.1.1,1,App malfunctioned and would stay on the loading page for hours. No matter what I did the app wouldn‚Äôt work. Finally when it did work I lost 2.5 years worth of boosters. To say I‚Äôm livid would be an understatement.

candycrush,ca,1.195.1.1,1,"Why, if developer makes a lot of money on me by making me to watch tens of advertisements per session, still they make me not to enjoy playing?
Everything in this game is made to upset and drive you nuts in hopes that you will be spending money on countless upgrades just to pass a stupidly designed level!!!
Or may be developer wants me to get tired of all that crap, lose my interest, delete the game and move to something else, more enjoyable..."

candycrush,ca,1.194.0.2,5,"I always turn to Candy Crush to clear my mind, stop worrying about life and things. I love it.

Suggestion to the developers: if possible, this may be a small but nice thing - before a level, one has the option to play a video to win boosters etc. However, if you already have some boosters in addition, you have to click on them so that they‚Äôre checkmarked BEFORE you click the ‚Äòplay video‚Äô button, otherwise, once the ad finishes, you are stuck playing that level with ONLY what you win during that ad and there is no option to go back and also select whatever boosters you already had. In other words, if you forget to check them off before you play the ad, that‚Äôs all you get. Maybe pause the screen after the ad finishes so the player can see all of the boosters they can use. This is a minor suggestion and one that likely has reasons for being otherwise, but figured I‚Äôd write it. Thank you!"
candycrush,ca,1.194.0.2,1,So boring when you‚Äôre up in the 5000 level and you‚Äôre stuck for days on end on the same board. The developers took away so much fun in this game and zero fun anymore.
candycrush,ca,1.194.0.2,1,"The game itself is ok, but over time greedy King has taken away every possible way to get gold bars except through in app purchases. Will change to 5 star if they return these features"
candycrush,ca,1.194.0.2,2,You‚Äôve gotten a lot stingier with rewards. I liked it better before.
candycrush,ca,1.194.0.2,1,"‚ÄúRelax and play candy‚Äù???

I‚Äôve been trying to pass the same level for FIVE DAYS! 

RELAXING? I think not!

For anyone thinking about starting this game I suggest you try something else. This game will be FRUSTRATING and ANGER YOU and does not care about anything else that you could be looking to escape from by playing games to get your mind off things. And this all happens to get you to SPEND MONEY that you will never get back and you will get nothing in return for the money you‚Äôre spending!

CHOOSE A DIFFERENT GAME!"
candycrush,ca,1.194.0.2,1,"This game is fun during downtime, nice distraction. However, suddenly i was unable to open it...?"
candycrush,ca,1.194.0.2,1,"Ne s‚Äôouvre pas sur iphone depuis 2 semaines, malgr√© la mise √† jour."
candycrush,ca,1.194.0.2,1,Cash grab rigged app. Always trying to screw your into purchases while having 40 pop-ups before and after every level. Disappointing and dishonest
candycrush,ca,1.194.0.2,5,Probl√®me de connexion √† toutes les fois qu‚Äôil y a une mise √† jour. Que dois-je faire?
candycrush,ca,1.194.0.2,5,Great
candycrush,ca,1.194.0.2,3,Used to have 5 or 15 second ads which were bearable. Now the same 30 second ads keep appearing! 30s is longer than some of the boards! Like the game but the ads are too much!
candycrush,ca,1.194.0.2,5,This game is very relaxing my grandchildren play it for come down time‚Äùtime out‚Äù love it work 95%of the time
candycrush,ca,1.194.0.2,5,"At first I didn't see what all this fuss was about, peope saying what a fantastic game this is, so I downloaded it to give it a try- it did not disappoint."

candycrush,ca,1.193.0.2,5,L‚Äôapplication sur mon iPhone a cess√© de fonctionner depuis mardi dernier et j‚Äô√©tais au niveau 8 450 environ j‚Äôavais achet√© 1000 lingots et j‚Äôavais √©galement beaucoup de boosters. Ai-je tout perdu ?  Assez poche.

candycrush,ca,1.193.0.2,2,SO ANNOTING WHEN I LOSE
candycrush,ca,1.193.0.2,5,Good fun!
candycrush,ca,1.193.0.2,1,"I mean, I get it. They have hard levels every now and again. Sure. It keeps the game tough while also still fun on the other levels. But your telling me that on level 525, one gets almost no moves, bombs, and a nearly impossible method of destroying those bombs? You NEED either the donut thing or the rainbow thing. But oh wait, even if you clear those blocks at the top 4 drops, you have to now find a way to, in a nutshell, get every nut/shell down to the ground in every move.

I mean, I had all 4 blocks cleared, and I had used the rainbow, pink donut, and the bomb/stripe bits to give me a boost. I still ran out of moves. If you don‚Äôt play this level without any boosts, your just wasting your time.

I mean, at the very least make it so enough of those nuts/shells we need to get to the bottom appear so that we can at least get it all done within the very limited amount of tasks!

This game just got too much. They wanted to keep it alive, sure, and they needed to make it challenging so people didn‚Äôt get too bored. That was my 20th time playing that level. I‚Äôm done. Deleted.

See you never Candy Crush!"
candycrush,ca,1.193.0.2,1,The new update has frozen the game. Can‚Äôt get passed the treat calendar.

candycrush,ca,1.193.0.2,1,"Played this game for years and climbed very high in levels. However, due to persistent crashing (even after a new release) I had no choice but to uninstall/re-install the app to which I had to start all over again. Will never play again.."
candycrush,ca,1.193.0.2,4,"my candy crush application refuses to open despite an update today, and has been for about 1 week ..."
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,1,"Almost every single time I try to watch a commercial for a booster or extra moves, the game crashes. No boosters or extra moves makes game extra hard to play, and unenjoyable. I can't recommend this game. It is not fun."
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,5,"Love this game but as soon as I open it, it crashes. Haven‚Äôt been able to play in a few weeks."
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,3,"The latest update is overheating my iPhone, nothing else is running in the background either. I cannot play until this is fixed. Please update it."
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,1,"I‚Äôve been playing this game on and off for almost 8 years now, and the levels just keep going up, making it impossible to reach the top because the levels are rigged to be hard. The levels are also duplicates of previous levels with just fewer moves to make it harder, so it gets pretty boring and frustrating after awhile when you‚Äôre stuck on a level for several days.

Also, beware of the game double charging you. I‚Äòve had it happen a few times and KING denied it and put the blame on me for purchasing it more than once as they claim to have a sound purchase authentification system. I had to take the fight with Apple. Don‚Äôt waste your money on this game."
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,1,"Tell me why I can boosters but not use them, 57 wheels, why can‚Äôt I pick to use them, what and when can I use them? Also you spitting spinning boxes that take 5 direct hits to blow up, why can they do moves and I can‚Äôt your programmers need to pull there heads out and what‚Äôs fair for you program should be fair for the user!!seems that your programming makes decisions on when I can make a move, as that the only time you can beat me off.!,"
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,5,I‚Äôm not a game person but I enjoy playing candy crash saga it‚Äôs really good game.
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,5,Je ne me tannerai jamais de ce jeu
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,5,üòç!
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,2,I think the game is great but it least does most of the work for you and when I didn't even touch the candy it just disappeared .
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,1,"If you want to win, you have to pay money,the time they allow to move at some where is not passible to achieve! Scamer game!"
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,5,Best game ever.  It‚Äôs frickin addicting af tho
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,1,"I‚Äôve set up candy crush 4  times and I DID not receive any gold bars- I restart often because the game is really hard at 68 (level)... the game says 4+ (years), that not true... I‚Äôve had a brain injury.
Besides the game being rigged, it‚Äôs too challenging. It‚Äôs better to start again and again, then, tracking (number ) is assigned, and candy crush gets redundant with setting games up kinda stupid with setting people up to fail ( not enjoy the game)."
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,5,"This Candy Crunch is freezing a few times and lose the picture there. Please update is needed. Thanks

It‚Äôs doing it again. This time, it just shut down and can‚Äôt open it again. Please fix this."
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,2,"I got close to level 300 and it was fun, but now it crashes every time I try to open the app."
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,5,I love this game!
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,5,"I have been playing Candy Crush for eight years or more and it‚Äôs always been my go to. But it‚Äôs getting more frustrating with the latest updates and you only win a booster for 15mins. Now I could get a coconut wheel but the level I‚Äôm playing doesn‚Äôt have  a coconut wheel so I actually get nothing. I‚Äôve also noticed times when I‚Äôve made 4 but don‚Äôt get a striped OR I use a striped and it shoots across but doesn‚Äôt actually take anything out. What‚Äôs happening?  I‚Äôm wondering if less people are playing so they are looking to make more money making you buy.
Always loved this game but time to say bye bye.  I‚Äôm beginning to think it‚Äôs fixed.  I got a multi by a striped red, then filled the color streak with red, so now it‚Äôs a sea of red. I hit the multi to the striped red, now they‚Äôre all striped. It explodes. Wonderful! But somehow i still don‚Äôt get out.
December 2020.  In spite of having many more playing due to CoVid, it seems to be set by the game.  I know straight away when there‚Äôs no chance I‚Äôm going to get out. But even worse, to buy bars or anything else is getting extremely expensive. Sad.  Actually getting more expensive every week.  Come on! Sure you want to make money, but don‚Äôt be greedy."
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,4,"When you make in-app purchases, you are charged multiple times for the same thing."
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,1,I almost completed the game and never got a jackpot. If you watch videos only then you can get some boosters. Hate it.
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,1,The new boosters  timing are very bad
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,5,This game is so cool
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,1,"If you're looking for something where you control the pace of your progression with effort and time, this isn't the game for you.  They dictate your progression by giving you bad starting tables and bad drops that would make completing higher levels impossible.

If you want a game where your moves don't make much of a difference and you rely on luck, enjoy this game."

candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,4,I‚Äôve just updated the new version of the game and I hate the new effect of the striped candies. It‚Äôs too blinding and gives me a glitchy heavy feel. Please bring back the old effect. Thank you.

candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,1,Bad
candycrush,ca,1.192.0.1,1,So it told me to save my progress. I signed up with apple and it said it will be saving my info with apple.  Now I log in and I am at level 1 from 1700.  Thanks.

candycrush,ca,1.191.0.2,1,"I used to love candy crush. I was obsessed, and played whenever I got the chance. But with this new update the levels are impossible to pass. They have removed a bunch of moves from the levels. I was having some troubles with a level a few weeks ago so I decided to search it up on YouTube for some tips and I noticed that the level used to have over 70 moves but now only has about 15 moves. It‚Äôs not just one level but a ton. And u can‚Äôt preview levels like u used to, and you lose a life if you exit the game even without using any of the moves. The game is not fun anymore.

Just because people win in a few moves you take moves away from the rest of us who are not lucky enough to get a good board and win with very few moves.. now takes us forever to move forward... when u win a game and get rewards and then you are supposed to get more with more consecutive wins and now it looks like you get more but you don‚Äôt... only stays on the first reward... you can‚Äôt even win bars anymore... in order to buy more moves... and sorry I am not rich to be able to spend real money on a game... thanks for ruining a great game..
Oh and when those stupid Genie lamps are on the board if it is on the board you are playing u can‚Äôt play what is that all about....have to wait till it moves... can‚Äôt you put it somewhere else??"

candycrush,ca,1.186.0.3,4,Disappointed that I have to pay to play this game. I understand the economics of the thing but really are you not almost not creating an addiction by cutting people off between levels?. I like the game but will no longer be playing because it‚Äôs too expensive. I am scared to see what the charges on my visa bill will be this month

candycrush,ca,1.186.0.3,1,"If you want to keep your sanity, do not download this game. 

This game is the literal definition of pay to win. The game gives you garbage moves and makes it almost impossible to beat levels without using power ups. 

If you‚Äôre willing to spend money getting more lives, and more power ups you will succeed and find the game fun. However if you‚Äôre like the average player that doesn't want spend money on a free game you will become unbelievably frustrated with how bad this game really is."
candycrush,ca,1.186.0.3,2,This game used to just be fun and now since the update it‚Äôs changed how am I supposed to win such a hard level with 10 moves? The answer is spending money which this isn‚Äôt even a game you should spend money on. Used to be better (if your on a lower level it‚Äôs more fun because it‚Äôs not impossible)
candycrush,ca,1.186.0.3,2,Why does it constantly ask to login to fb when I am already logged in please fix this bugs so I can give lives.

candycrush,ca,1.186.0.3,2,"When I first started to play Candy Crush, it was great.    Now it feels more-like a cunning scam; forcing players to either buy in-game boosters, or stay on same level for days ‚Äî or weeks ‚Äî at a time.    It‚Äôs really too bad; the game used to be a lot of fun, but now I need  to de-stress AFTER playing this game."
candycrush,ca,1.185.0.1,5,Super fun game!
candycrush,ca,1.185.0.1,5,Relaxing and fun
candycrush,ca,1.185.0.1,4,Please bring back the wheel the gives extra moves and the daily calendar with boosters please. Why were they both taken away? They both help with difficult levels. Bring them both back the game isn‚Äôt as enjoyable as it used to be.
candycrush,ca,1.185.0.1,1,After several years of playing I‚Äôve given up on this game.. they‚Äôve crippled it so much so that people can‚Äôt progress at a reasonable rate without purchasing bonuses. You keep on changing things cause you see it as an exploit or a ‚Äúglitch‚Äù. You win King!
candycrush,ca,1.185.0.1,1,You can even not pass more levels without spending into the game? That‚Äôs a waste of time from your company!! SHAME ON YOU!!!
candycrush,ca,1.185.0.1,3,So basically you have to buy lives a lot of times to actually pass levels and that gets annoying. Some people don‚Äôt have money to spend on a stupid game. Other than that  it‚Äôs a great game‚ú®üòäüî™

candycrush,ca,1.184.1.2,3,Ever since I updated to the new iOS the possibility to spin the wheel every 48 hours to add moves or earn bonuses has disappeared. I really don‚Äôt understand why. I have been playing this game for 3 years and it is the first time I don‚Äôt see this icon after my moves are up. It is really frustrating because I will not spend money on bonuses!!! Please fix this issue
candycrush,ca,1.184.1.2,1,Je n‚Äôaime vraiment pas la suggestion de mouvement a tout les coups. Je suis capable de jouer sans cela et c‚Äôest franchement aga√ßant.
candycrush,ca,1.184.1.2,4,Anyone knows how to link it with Facebook every time it is taking me to my daughter‚Äôs account when I click on Facebook option
candycrush,ca,1.184.1.2,2,Although games should be challenging they shouldn‚Äôt be impossible to win at because then they are no fun. As you get to higher levels you have to play the 50 times to finish as they are too hard with too few moves. You took away the chance to win moves and your just out to make money by making levels too hard without boosters that you need to buy. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this game to anyone
candycrush,ca,1.184.1.2,4,Very relaxing Hardin‚Äôs
candycrush,ca,1.184.1.2,3,Greed... no more fun u less you spend big money. Too bad but this game is done for me. I‚Äôve spent enough only at level 2400 and no more money for you guys for nothing
candycrush,ca,1.184.1.2,5,I like this game because it has lots of boosters!
candycrush,ca,1.184.1.2,5,The Best
candycrush,ca,1.184.1.2,5,"HI I love this game! Just wanted to let you guys at King know that today there‚Äôs problems with connecting to the App Store for bonus spins, etc even though I have good wifi connectivity."
candycrush,ca,1.184.1.2,1,I would give it 0 starts if I could. Every update has been worst and worst and forced you to make in app purchases. I thought I notices this before - I would see charges on my card and I would not be sure if I made the purchase. I would buy the gold bar once in a while so I wouldn‚Äôt know if I bought it two times in one day. But yesterday I noticed they charged me 2 times!!! And I KNOW I only bought something one time. I reported the issue to Apple support. This is very shady Candy Crash.
candycrush,ca,1.183.0.3,5,Great game for consuming time
candycrush,ca,1.183.0.3,5,"I have played this game during my each boring lecture and i really loved it. Its been years I haven‚Äôt played and i downloaded it again, and hope the updates and version are more cooler than years back"
candycrush,ca,1.183.0.3,1,I just seen the ad for candy crush and it was so bad I had to write a review just to let you know it literally made me wanna kill myself because it made me so uncomfortable

candycrush,ca,1.183.0.3,1,Worst game updates ever. Ruined the experience... garbage greedy game
candycrush,ca,1.183.0.3,3,No friends list...can‚Äôt give or receive lives.  Bring back this feature.
candycrush,ca,1.183.0.3,1,I deleted this ‚Äúgame‚Äù at level 4628 because it‚Äôs not fun anymore. It‚Äôs been so hard that I wasn‚Äôt not even motivated to play. You should have serious issues to make a game so impossible to win
candycrush,ca,1.183.0.3,5,It‚Äôs good

candycrush,ca,1.183.0.3,5,"Why are levels different for some people?  I am on level 4052 and have to complete this level in 17 moves, whereas others online have 27 moves. This is. It the first time I‚Äôve. It iced this issue. Very frustrating that there‚Äôs no consistencies. 
Is there something I‚Äôm missing?  There are no updates for this app as my updates are automatic. Plain and simple....update this level to 27 moves for everyone. Otherwise, this game is awesome!"
candycrush,ca,1.183.0.3,1,"I have been stuck on level 1239 for about two weeks now and this game is not fun anymore. Maybe if you stopped making the levels next to impossible, it would actually be a great game.

candycrush,ca,1.180.0.1,1,Loved the game until the new update that made it look like soda crush. Hate the graphics now.
candycrush,ca,1.180.0.1,5,It‚Äôs so realxing!
candycrush,ca,1.180.0.1,1,"One would think that by using a striped candy it would get rid of everything in that row. I‚Äôve just used up 6 lives and several boosters trying to pass one level because the striped candy would not get rid of the liquorice which in turn does not drop a sufficient amount of candy to even have a chance of beating the level. 
Also, when I was playing as a guest it gave me 5 gold for every episode I finished, but after logging in and connecting my game to my Facebook, it doesn‚Äôt? 
Used to be fun, not really anymore."
candycrush,ca,1.180.0.1,1,This game is not fun anymore! I‚Äôve been playing for years and now have been stuck on the same level for a month now! Where‚Äôs the win moves wheel after an attempt at a level?? Used to get a free spin after 48hrs now you have to use gold to spin which you don‚Äôt get anymore! Make it fun again.
candycrush,ca,1.180.0.1,3,Anytime I try to talk to my partner she‚Äôs playing candy crush and I just need to talk to her so if you could remove the game that would be great
candycrush,ca,1.180.0.1,5,i can‚Äôt stop crushing candies. all i know now is to match 3 candies. this has become my life. i cant stop and it‚Äôs been affecting my life in multiple ways. i no longer tend to my own needs. great game overall.

candycrush,ca,1.180.0.1,5,Keep my mind young üëè
candycrush,ca,1.180.0.1,1,"This game is fun until you reach higher levels and then it becomes a total money grab!! You can't win at higher levels without spending money, and they overcharge for what the packages offer. They would have more players and make more money if they charged 1/4 of what they do. This is a GAME and there are lots of free games that aren't constantly trying to get money from the players. Weekly winners get no return for what it takes to one first! It's become a total rip off. The only way to play his game is to start over each time you reach level 1000! I can see this game dying because of
F the developer's greed. Shame."
candycrush,ca,1.180.0.1,4,They are very annoying!
candycrush,ca,1.180.0.1,2,"Bought boosters and coins, got the boosters but not the coins. Had to fight with them back and forth just to get $2.79 purchase of coins. 
You used to win stuff all the time, now even when you collect all the scrolls or coins in the piggy bank you have to pay to collect your own rewards. I‚Äôm on level 2242 and I had two candied balls side by side, my next move was to swipe them together and blow up the whole board but a chocolate ate one of them instead of the one of the 2 random plain candies on another part of the board. I am more frustrated in this game then I am enjoying it anymore...think it‚Äôs time to quit. Bye Candy Crush, if you ever go back to how good you used to be...let me know."
candycrush,ca,1.180.0.1,1,I love this game and find it relaxing UNTIL the game has bombs in it. Going to delete it as it‚Äôs too stressful.
candycrush,ca,1.180.0.1,1,"Seriously, pls add some confirmation before validating purchases with gold. More than once I mistakenly pressed on buy extra moves or lives!! And where is the free win moves wheel every 48h??? You don‚Äôt need such methods, this game already rips people off..."

candycrush,ca,1.180.0.1,4,Pour moi c'est un bon passe temps. Je fait habituellement une centaine de niveau puis je recommence. Je ne veux pas m'investir plus que √ßa.
candycrush,ca,1.180.0.1,3,"It‚Äôs a good game, though my one criticism is that it shows you the next move way too soon. I‚Äôd like to do it myself, but the next answer flashes almost as soon as you make a move."
candycrush,ca,1.180.0.1,5,Wow great fun üòÄüòÄüòÄ
candycrush,ca,1.180.0.1,1,"I am on level 4421. I have always loved the game but I have to tell you, levels like this (and there have been others) make you want to quit or throw your phone against the wall or both. Seriously though, levels like this are no longer fun. They are frustrating. If they want people to keep playing they need to stop throwing these near impossible frustrating hard levels that are no longer fun to play because they become stressful and not wipe the stress away by playing like they claim. There are too many of these levels up here. Stop them or I will stop playing. Plus they took away certain bonuses. Not cool!"
candycrush,ca,1.180.0.1,3,Wish we could have a chance for unlimited lives
candycrush,ca,1.180.0.1,1,"game is not as fun as it used to be. free boosters or previewing a level without losing a life is no longer an option. it is pay to win and i‚Äôm not putting my money into a stupid game. as you get higher the levels become impossible to pass, it‚Äôs supposed to be challenging not impossible i don‚Äôt wanna spend three weeks trying to pass one level. will be deleting this game."
candycrush,ca,1.180.0.1,2,Nice game and it should be good as stress relief but...Actually its very stressful when you play and then you need to wait 30min so you can play again.
candycrush,ca,1.180.0.1,3,It‚Äôs not bad it‚Äôs because  sometime when I do a move that‚Äôs good it doesn‚Äôt work usually

candycrush,ca,1.179.0.3,4,"I haven‚Äôt been playing CC for the last 8 years because I love a challenge..  I play because I can‚Äôt just sit and do nothing when I talk, walk, watch TV or live! It occupies me!! 
I‚Äôve been stuck at level 4832 forever and I stopped playing because being stuck IS NOT ENTERTAINING!! 
I don‚Äôt need the levels to get harder now!! 
DO SOMETHING!! 
Sincerely, J"
candycrush,ca,1.179.0.3,4,I love this game I play it all the time but there is a slight problem with it and that is even when I watch an ad for a prize it doesn‚Äôt give it to me. Or when I have more points than someone on the leaderboard and it‚Äôs kind of annoying sometimes. But other than that it‚Äôs super fun and it‚Äôs really relaxing I recommend it
candycrush,ca,1.179.0.3,2,"Their slogan is ‚Äúswipe the stress away‚Äù but it should be ‚Äúadd stress to your day.‚Äù Too many levels rely on a lucky shuffle to pass. More often than not the ‚Äúnightmarishly hard‚Äù levels can be passed in one try, but yet you can get stuck on a regular level for multiple days just waiting for that lucky shuffle."
candycrush,ca,1.179.0.3,5,U must download this game!!
candycrush,ca,1.179.0.3,2,Every time I save my game at some point I have to start over gets very frustrating to loose everything after months of playing.  Going from level 1687 to 1 is not a good experience
candycrush,ca,1.178.0.3,1,"I have been playing this game for 8 years. I was past level 1500 and had over 100 of every item stocked up as well as 84 gold bars. It told me to log into Facebook to save my progress, so I did then lost EVERYTHING. After months of trying to contact them, finally they responded saying they will not replace lost items. Do not play any KING games if you wish to keep your progress safe. Terrible policies and terrible customer service."

candycrush,ca,1.178.0.3,1,"I played CCS a few years ago then left it. Now I‚Äôm leaving it again. After a certain point in the games, it becomes obvious that the only way to win is to keep forking over money. Once in awhile, okay. But most games after a certain level, come on. Done."
candycrush,ca,1.178.0.3,3,"Level 291 is so ridiculously hard that I‚Äôm thinking of deleting the app. I feel like some levels are glitchy and/or the amount of moves does not work out for it at all. I‚Äôve been stuck at 291 for almost 2 weeks now and even if I only need to get one more cherry, it‚Äôs just not showing up. I‚Äôve spend so much time on this and it‚Äôs stupid and frustrating. makes me not want to play the game anymore.

candycrush,ca,1.178.0.3,5,"Love the game, stellar concept, dope animations, for the love of all things good and pure please stop updating it and changing how things look, the new frosting is uglier than I was as a child and the watch-forty-seconds-of-advertisements-first boost wheel keeps getting worse and worse, bro all I want is the chance to momentarily be the protagonist in my own story and luck out and get that sweet sweet fifteen bonus moves and finally move on from the clear all the jelly level that I‚Äôve been stuck on for the last six weeks and maybe get a bit of serotonin in my flaming trash fire brain, as a treat, but instead I get the change to earn three moves and somehow always end up with jellyfish, and even though jellyfish are sick as all sick things are ill, they don‚Äôt help me out in the moment when a ray of hope is shining on my once youthful face and then shines directly into my eyes because it was never hope, it was a spotlight, and I‚Äôm on the stage of life forgetting my lines and hoping the extra moves will feed me my line, and I‚Äôm blinded by a jellyfish moving the spotlight up and to the left by twelve degrees, anyway, cool game, updates ugly tho"

candycrush,ca,1.177.1.3,1,"I have two separate games on two devices. They have changed certain levels so that they are impossible to pass without having to pay for/use extra boosters. When I passed level 223 in my one ongoing game, you had to reach a set score to pass the level. Now I‚Äôm playing on my other device two weeks later and it‚Äôs the same board but  now they expect you to clear 81 double jellies amongst liquorice and icing. I‚Äôve been playing for over a week and I can NEVER reach the top 4 jellies in the corner. I‚Äôd have to use a ton of boosters to complete this level. 
Same goes for level 516. It used to be liquorice at the bottom and only a few icings to contend with (I looked up how to pass this level and it was completely different). Well now it‚Äôs ALL icings-no liquorice- and I haven‚Äôt been able to come close to passing it in days. I‚Äôve tried to contact them to explain the situation for both levels and all I get in return is generic answers and reminders that I can use my boosters and other helpful tools. Aka spend money to pass the level. Sorry Candy Crush. There are quite a lot of similar games out there that aren‚Äôt as greedy and sneaky as you are. I‚Äôll just go play them and I recommend others do the same."

You give helpers that come with timers, we barely get good boosters. Everything comes with 15 minutes. You sell $3 worth of boosters and they are all times- you give little gold bars. 

You‚Äôre making the levels harder and making it more impossible to win, yes we love a challenge but don‚Äôt push it. It‚Äôs getting uncanny. We should be able to enjoy our game with the perks that we want at the very least. A lot of us have been here forever.

This game loves to bring in a false sense of confidence as you breeze through the levels. Lot‚Äôs of social competition, and overall a great way to reward players. Then comes the later levels.. soon after you‚Äôre faced with levels too stressful for it‚Äôs own good, heavily relying on the luck of the draw or heavily relying on you making an in-app purchase. I‚Äôm alright with freemium games. In fact, I think it‚Äôs fair to give paying players an upper hand to magnify their experience. But when it‚Äôs heavily implied by the devs that you should consider sinking some money into their games.. it becomes less enjoyable. The development of these levels in the later stages are mediocre at best. The fact that the level had to reshuffle three times in a row just shows that the random nature with their ‚ÄúPaywall‚Äù difficulty just doesn‚Äôt mix. Id rather be paying for an app game upfront than to deal with freemium garbage like this. I really hope a good competitor comes and sweeps up their playerbase over their shenanigans"

candycrush,ca,1.176.0.2,1,I Love This Game But I Delated The Game Because The Game Lost Progress
candycrush,ca,1.176.0.2,5,"Please come up with more infinity lives so that we can keep playing and stay home and have some to do.
Thanks"
candycrush,ca,1.176.0.2,1,"Every time I log on, the game will always click on a random level and when I leave I lose a life
And now I only have four lives. That‚Äôs not fair"
candycrush,ca,1.176.0.2,2,"Your F150 ad will not work even after I updated my candy crush. It will not RUN or provide an ""x"" to exit out of so I have to leave candy crush altogether and the log back in to be able to carry on with my levels. So frustrating!!! In the last 15 minutes alone I have had to leave candy crush 4 times and this has been going on for 2 days."
candycrush,ca,1.176.0.2,1,Why can I not go on candy crush after they updated it today?
candycrush,ca,1.176.0.2,1,I connected my candy crush app with Facebook finally after I had reached level 956 and had many perks like they were in hundreds because I like to collect them but as soon as I connect it to my Facebook I loose all my extra things I collected and I get set back to level 939 which I highly unfair. I don‚Äôt want to play anymore because I have lost all my collected stuff for future help because I tried to connect my candy crush and Facebook.
candycrush,ca,1.175.0.4,5,Good Times
candycrush,ca,1.175.0.4,5,Love Candy Crush. Lots of Competition with family and friends!
candycrush,ca,1.175.0.4,5,Candy crush is a fun and addictive game and it great for staying inside
candycrush,ca,1.175.0.4,5,"May 3-They finally gave the option to turn off the hints! I haven‚Äôt played in over a year because of the hints. I came back after I found out you can now turn them off and it‚Äôs as fun as ever. Very happy. 

Feb 5th-I keep seeing all these ads saying come back, we miss you. The reason I quit was because King REFUSED to turn off the terrible blinking hints that a ton of people hate. I want to play a game not have the game played for me. It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous and I will never play this game again unless they at least give a turn off hints button. It‚Äôs stupid and annoying. 

Edit: If you‚Äôre looking for a game that actually lets you play instead of flashing a move at you after 1 second then I suggest Toon Blast. It‚Äôs kind of similar and never shows you moves no matter how long you wait. 

I had previously given this game 3 stars and the only reason it didn‚Äôt get 5 stars was because of the super annoying hints that you couldn‚Äôt turn off. I‚Äôve since went looking for support on this issue only to find numerous requests to have the hints turned off or have it as an option. So obviously King is aware that their players find this super annoying but they just don‚Äôt give a darn.  I‚Äôm boycotting this game and all King games. It‚Äôs not fun anymore and King just doesn‚Äôt care."
candycrush,ca,1.175.0.4,5,10 out of 10 so much fun!!
candycrush,ca,1.175.0.4,1,I truly hate the new candy crush I‚Äôm at 6762 and the new blocks you have to break is annoying. It just frustrates me so I‚Äôll probably delete. When a game becomes frustrating it‚Äôs not worth it.
candycrush,ca,1.175.0.4,1,I hate the new update like massively
candycrush,ca,1.175.0.4,5,This is just for fun.
candycrush,ca,1.175.0.4,2,the fun is gone.  no boosters to help pass a level.  not buying to get boosters  either.  Been playing for years but its changed and not fun any more.

candycrush,ca,1.175.0.4,5,"This game is so addicting and so much fun! I love it and everything in it! 
The only thing I don't like is that when you get further into the levels, it's gets so hard that I have to spend so much time on one level and get behind."
candycrush,ca,1.175.0.4,3,"This game is addictive and fun but some of the later levels become very frustrating because there‚Äôs no strategy involved and you‚Äôre only to win the level when they decide you can. I‚Äôve lost interest, not interested in rigged games."
candycrush,ca,1.175.0.4,5,Thank you for making this game

Je suis au dernier niveau et j‚Äôattends chaque semaine la sortie des nouveaux niveaux et ce depuis plusieurs ann√©es ... entre temps je me ramasse des outils pour passer le temps.

J‚Äôimagine eu ceci est une d√©cision corporative et que dans les faits des milliers de personnes comme moi n‚Äôinvestissent pas dans votre jeu.

Je suis triste et d√©√ßu !

candycrush,ca,1.174.0.2,5,"I love this game, it's so addicting and the gameplay is phenominal"
candycrush,ca,1.174.0.2,5,Bien tr√®s bien
candycrush,ca,1.174.0.2,2,Played for 1 week and at first really liked then it started to crash and would do so in midst of a game.  Would do this at least 2 out of 5 lives. This morning it crashed all 5 lives.  I gave them a lot of money.  Well no more!!!  Fix it or replace my lives every time it crashes.   I paid you.  A fool and his music money and all that.
candycrush,ca,1.174.0.2,5,This game is just really fun. It‚Äôs nice to play for a little while and escape from the stresses of your life. It‚Äôs very relaxing and can be a fun distraction or something to do when you‚Äôre bored. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking to play it. Looking forward to trying out the other games
candycrush,ca,1.174.0.2,4,"dear candy crush, 
now .. at this time(covid-19), when people are sitting home please try to set unlimited lifes for few days so we can enjoy this game more. 
Thanks"
candycrush,ca,1.174.0.2,5,"J‚Äôadore jouer √† Candy Crush mais je trouve trop long le temps pour avoir de nouvelles vies pour rejouer, au cinq minutes serait plus appr√©ci√©. Merci"
candycrush,ca,1.173.1.1,1,They give you prizes to make it a little easier and then they take them away. Getting tired of this game.
candycrush,ca,1.173.1.1,2,The game is fun to a certain point. However  having only 5 lives is not enough especially when you earn rewards that give you 3-4 hours of certain power usages. You have to wait for your lives to replenish again which eats up your time. Doesn‚Äôt really make you wanna keep earning rewards if u die and can‚Äôt use them as much
candycrush,ca,1.173.1.1,1,I hate when I purchase something by mistake wasting my gold. Can we have a confirmation before purchase?
candycrush,ca,1.173.1.1,1,You should be ashamed
candycrush,ca,1.173.1.1,2,Message says connect to the internet to receive my rewards which I already am!
candycrush,ca,1.173.1.1,5,Je suis au 5100ieme niveau et je manque de motivation. Il n‚Äôy a plus assez de booster. √áa prend trop de temps pour avancer. Si √ßa ne change pas je vais arr√™ter de jouer.
candycrush,ca,1.173.1.1,1,Les niveaux sont difficiles M√äME avec boosters et les choses co√ªtent cher et c‚Äôest cheap! J‚Äôaime √† peine ce jeu.
candycrush,ca,1.173.1.1,1,They give you free lives while Covid-19 is going on but make it impossible to win a game without spending an arm and a leg!!!!   ü§£üòÇ     No thanks!!!!
candycrush,ca,1.173.1.1,5,Fun.
candycrush,ca,1.173.1.1,1,"I tried to switch some and it didn‚Äôt work- so I tried again- and wasted another one of the power ups (or whatever they are called), and it didn‚Äôt work either. Just took away the two power ups I used and I lost the game I‚Äôve been trying to beat :(
Sucks but I hope you guys can fix this little problem"
candycrush,ca,1.173.1.1,5,I really like it it's really addicting and it has a bit of a challenge ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è

candycrush,ca,1.173.1.1,1,"This level is complete BS.  You do not have enough time to pop the time bombs, let alone have any item to support you. The fish do not help at all. This is such a dumb frustrating level and needs to be fixed"
candycrush,ca,1.173.1.1,5,Wouldn‚Äôt have reviewed if not for unlimited lives thx guys!
candycrush,ca,1.173.1.1,1,Every noticed that sometimes it isn‚Äôt being fair? Why would it not give me the better candies sometimes. Seems pretty silly that the game doesn‚Äôt give the stripe candy the right way pretty often and noticed quite a few times that it doesn‚Äôt give me the better candy sometimes to keep me redoing a level. Such an annoying game
candycrush,ca,1.173.1.1,5,Love this game it‚Äôs so addictive but in a great way! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòä

candycrush,ca,1.173.0.2,5,Love this game üíõ
candycrush,ca,1.173.1.1,5,"I just want to say that you are amazing for letting us play this game without restrictions. This is such a stressful time for so many people, and your kindness and thoughtfulness are greatly appreciated. Stay safe and happy everybody."
candycrush,ca,1.173.1.1,1,"This game is getting so boring now after level 6000.  Just swipe and see what may fall. No fun, no skill, pure luck.  For 20 moves game, you will know you are going to pass or not when you make the first 3 moves."
candycrush,ca,1.173.0.2,1,The game is no longer fun now that you took away boosters (gained from build a bot or helmets) that you earned from previously played levels. I suppose it‚Äôs due to greed to try to get more people to pay for them.
candycrush,ca,1.173.0.2,1,How am I expected to play level 6634 without boosters? Practically impossible. I refuse to pay to play.
candycrush,ca,1.173.0.2,1,You got rid of the Sugar Track to make room for other ‚Äòplans‚Äô. Leaving us currently with nothing? Everyone is stuck at home with nothing to do except play games and you drop the best feature to collect boosters?!? Are you hoping without daily boosters people will now spend real money? Not a good look for you guys.
candycrush,ca,1.173.0.2,2,"Been playing this game for years and got addicted!! However, the feature where the pairs light up is rather annoying. Happens too soon, and doesn‚Äôt even give you a chance to look for pairs yourself. Takes the fun out of the game."
candycrush,ca,1.173.0.2,2,My save progress keeps getting lost. I‚Äôm using Facebook to save but it‚Äôs not working?
candycrush,ca,1.173.0.2,1,"Since they took away most of the opportunities for boosters, this game has become nothing but boring and difficult. I loved Candy Crush but now it‚Äôs just beyond frustrating and that‚Äôs not how I want to spend my free time."

candycrush,ca,1.173.0.2,4,Cool game
candycrush,ca,1.173.0.2,1,I think during this unprecedented time while many candy crush players are self isolated or practicing social distancing is only fair and humanitarian that you guys from king give us infinite lives. I think that way you will going to help us keep at mental health and our partners alive. Thank you very much
candycrush,ca,1.173.0.2,2,Since the last update I can‚Äôt play anymore
candycrush,ca,1.173.0.2,1,Return candy crush build a bot on all past levels or I will soon quit playing this game !
candycrush,ca,1.172.0.1,1,After using all my booster I cleared all the chestnuts but the counter remained at one
candycrush,ca,1.172.0.1,5,Thanks
candycrush,ca,1.172.0.1,1,"I don think I will be playing anymore.  I didn‚Äôt complain when you can no longer check out a level, exit without making any moves, and get a re-shuffle without losing boosters and a life.  Now you cannot even build up your boosters in a previous level.  And your boosters does not show up in a previous level when you want to boost up your points."
candycrush,ca,1.172.0.1,3,Je trouve d√©cevant que vous changer les r√®gles qui √©taient l√† depuis longtemps. On n‚Äôa plus la possibilit√© d‚Äôamasser des points pour avoir des bonus.

candycrush,ca,1.172.0.1,5,"This game can be challenging at time, which makes it fun"
candycrush,ca,1.172.0.1,4,"I believe that this app would be more enjoyable if the hearts/lives would regenerate faster, rather than having to wait a long time for them to all recharge, especially with how things are currently, there isn‚Äôt much to do at home. Also, the chocolate moves that can be used with anything should not count as a move when there is no other options. it‚Äôs a way of forcing players to use their only option when if it was a normal power up, wouldn‚Äôt count as an option."
candycrush,ca,1.172.0.1,4,"This game is really fun and it‚Äôs really addicting! I love how you don‚Äôt need wifi either. The only problem I have, is that I can‚Äôt watch any ads to to get more lives or boosters like other candy crush users can. I really hope you can improve this."
candycrush,ca,1.172.0.1,1,I quit this game.
candycrush,ca,1.172.0.1,5,It os really good game
candycrush,ca,1.172.0.1,1,"So stupid, stuck on the same level for weeks because I will not buy power ups. Such a stupid game. Deleting it like everyone else does"
candycrush,ca,1.172.0.1,1,Played it the really hard levels require chance. Deleted it life is better without it.
candycrush,ca,1.172.0.1,1,"It is as much chance as Roulette and, as with casino Roulette, the House controls everything. You have to purchase‚Äîat exorbitant prices‚Äîextra ‚Äògold bars‚Äô to try to finish a game and then spin on a wheel on which every second category is five extra moves. But you can never play to win enough gold bars so they force you to buy. You buy once‚Äîand the spinner picks a booster ( of no use because you can‚Äôt go back to the game wherein you had one more move to finish until you win 5 extra moves). When you try to spin again, now they‚Äôre asking more than twice as much for gold bars. You go anyway‚Äîand the wheel delivers another booster. They see you want to finish this game‚Äîyou‚Äôve already paid real money twice‚Äîso now they‚Äôre going to ask for a good deal of money for a third spin. Like a gambling addict who has a ‚Äòcome to Jesus‚Äô monent at a table, I left the game and deleted it. Finished with these monsters. Don‚Äôt download this!"
candycrush,ca,1.172.0.1,1,"What the heck happened?  I was somewhere in the 1700‚Äôs level when all of a sudden it‚Äôs telling me I‚Äôm one of the best players and I‚Äôve completed all the levels!  And I suddenly have LOTS of lives, candy stripes and other boosters.  I mean LOTS.  Like around 100,000 more or less of each!  I can‚Äôt play at all now.  I‚Äôve done everything the game suggests doing to get levels back, but nothing has worked.  Frustrating!!"

candycrush,ca,1.170.0.2,2,After about level 175 the levels become way too hard to pass. Always have to use all your lives then wait 20 minutes to get one life (or watch an ad). Like How are you supposed to destroy 80 pieces of blue green and orange candy (240 pieces) within 25 moves?
candycrush,ca,1.170.0.2,2,For the past 2 weeks when a friend asks for a life I get 29 requests. This can repeat within 5 minutes. Please investigate for a bug.
candycrush,ca,1.170.0.2,2,"I used to always say that this is the only game that could hold my interest. I could reasonably move through levels without it being too easy or too difficult. The perfect challenge. BUT recently an update has resulted in a change where if you want to change up the board to a new configuration, you now lose a life in order to do that! And now I‚Äôve hit a level that even the experts can‚Äôt conquer in less than 70 attempts and that was done with the ability to reconfigure the board. I‚Äôm getting board of this level after so many attempts and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to end up giving up on my favorite game!

candycrush,ca,1.170.0.2,5,Love playing this game and it‚Äôs even more better now that they‚Äôve added videos to watch for extra moves and other things

candycrush,ca,1.170.0.2,2,"I think there is an app issue, no friend lives requests are being given or received. I now have 20 requests"
candycrush,ca,1.170.0.2,1,"I used to play this game all the time. I‚Äôve played for years. The levels used to be just challenging enough, but simple enough to pass, and I used to enjoy playing. This game isn‚Äôt nice like that anymore though. I understand the updates and efforts to remove glitches and cheats from the game, but the explicit algorithms that have been placed into the game to purposely make you lose and make it impossible for you to pass a level, especially with the small number of moves you‚Äôre given and only having 5 lives is not enough, it‚Äôs very unfair, and ridiculous. I don‚Äôt like the other candy crush versions either. The other version designed like the traditional old time game called ‚Äúthe game of life‚Äù is too easy and slow for my liking. I‚Äôm definitely just going to stop torturing myself. I‚Äôm absolutely done with this game. It‚Äôs being deleted. There‚Äôs no point and the rewards and bonuses are pointless with the algorithms set the way it is to make you fail. I just wanted to share this review with those of  who are interested in playing the game. You‚Äôll only be setting yourself up for lots of frustration and time wasted. Do not waste the precious time that God has given you by playing this game. Do yourself that much of a favour."

candycrush,nz,1.174.0.2,1,Be careful buying lives people. Every lives I‚Äôve brought they‚Äôve over charged me! Sometimes over $40 extra. I had no idea till I checked my bank statements a week later.
candycrush,nz,1.174.0.2,3,It‚Äôs a good game but after 5 seconds of logging into the game it pauses and quits. Please fix!!
candycrush,nz,1.169.1.1,1,"Used to relax and play this, now it's just frustrating and pisses me off. I don't expect it to be easy but I don't expect to take 5 years to pass one level either (unfortunately, i was stuck on one level for over 5 years after spending $40 to try and get past it and failing and refusing to spend more.) Too many annoying things to list, others have already listed them."
candycrush,nz,1.170.0.2,5,Awesome Game!!
candycrush,nz,1.170.0.2,5,Nice game
candycrush,nz,1.167.0.2,5,Great fun and good for 80year old brain
candycrush,nz,1.166.0.4,1,"Apple made the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù button redundant with the introduction of the iPhone X, yet the developers of ‚ÄúCandy Crush‚Äù are yet to adapt to the ‚Äúswipe‚Äù functionality of the newer model iPhones. While forcing the user to swipe multiple times to exit may keep them in the game fractionally longer, it guarantees that they don‚Äôt use it for some time afterwards. Stop adding extra ‚Äúbonuses‚Äù and focus on compatibility."
candycrush,nz,1.166.0.4,1,"I enjoy playing this game, however recently I changed my phone and some benefits have been removed from the new phone specifically the treat calendar. I also notice that playing the lower levels you get so much more benefits like spin for free moves and more boosters. I feel that this makes the game unfair. I feel you should provide more boosters and free spin at least on higher levels. Also move the treat calendar when moving phones."
candycrush,nz,1.166.0.4,5,Great game!
candycrush,nz,1.166.0.4,5,It's a great game of play
candycrush,nz,1.166.0.4,1,No longer able to back out and reset board. King is ripping players off as not only do we lose a life but we lose the boosters that were hard earned or paid for! How can King justify that to its players! It is an unfair playing field and the only winners are King.
candycrush,nz,1.165.2,4,four stars not five because crushing candy is mean and hurts the candy‚Äôs feelings :(
candycrush,nz,1.165.2,2,Don‚Äôt install. No quit to reset game without forfeiting a life. Last update blows. Far less rewards.
candycrush,nz,1.165.2,2,It used to be most rounds were enjoyable and the odd round would be frustrating unfortunately it is now the other way round. Some levels eg 3361 are straight up luck because you are not provided with enough to succeed until you get a lucky round after which you are blatantly aware that it was not skill that allowed you to pass the level. Levels that claim hard are easy and vice versa.
candycrush,nz,1.165.2,4,"This app is great and very addicting ! But one issue I find is that whenever I try to start the game, it always quits out for no reason! Please fix this issue as this is one of my favourite games"
candycrush,nz,1.164.0,5,My favourite game since i first came on line years ago
candycrush,nz,1.164.0,4,"Please fix this problem a.s.a.p. so I can play again as is only company I have.  My iPad also lost all the games a few updates back which had cost me a lot of money to go up levels and buy extra turns to finish games.  Was up to 310 now back to 80. iPod don't want to go back to zero as up to 275.
Don‚Äôt like the stupid bits in between games would rather get on with the game!"

candycrush,nz,1.162.1,5,I play this game on my iPad and iPhone. Completely different levels. Frustrating at times but always a boost when you pass a hard stage

candycrush,nz,1.146.1,1,Unable to play the next level without multiple menus popping up and interfering with a smooth transition to the next level. Very bad idea and irritating I will delete
candycrush,nz,1.145.0,1,"The new updates not allowing me to connect to Facebook, after a few tries it works, but when app closes and reopen it got kicks out from connecting to Facebook again."
candycrush,nz,1.145.0,5,Very fun addicting game I just wish I had unlimited lives
candycrush,nz,1.145.0,1,"Even after completing 2000 levels in 5 years I don‚Äôt have a sense of fulfilment. Because some profit making management decides to keep on creating more levels. There is no heart or soul to the game anymore . They just keep building more and more levels by twisting same old levels with different combinations. It‚Äôs a bottomless pit much like a ladies handbag! Don‚Äôt even get me started on meaningless ads. More than playing the game itself am clicking on ‚ÄúX‚Äù and ‚Äúok‚Äù. 
Shame"

candycrush,nz,1.143.0,1,"Been playing years, never brought anything until 3 weeks ago when I cashed in gold bars to get more lives. Since then if I run out of lives I‚Äôm not given a video to watch for another life. What a rip, you just want me to buy more. Deleting game now"

candycrush,nz,1.143.0,5,Is an amazing game but in app purchases are bugged :( brought the beginner pack for $6.99 NZD and it took the money and didn‚Äôt give me any of the stuff in the bundle apart from 20 gold ?! Not the first time this has happened üò™
candycrush,nz,1.142.0,5,Love the game
candycrush,nz,1.142.0,5,"I just recently had a baby and wanted a game i could play while i‚Äôm breastfeeding and i don‚Äôt know why but i downloaded candy crush, over the years i‚Äôve heard so many people talk about it but i‚Äôve never tried playing it and it‚Äôs probably the best game i‚Äôve played.

candycrush,nz,1.142.0,5,Great game to either fill in some time or to keep your mind active
candycrush,nz,1.142.0,1,"Candy crush takes away my ability to swipe up and go to my home screen etc. the XD does not have a home button as I‚Äôm sure you know, but because candy crush has decided it wants to use that space it hides the bar that I pull up that acts as my home button. It takes me 10 or more tries to close this app."

candycrush,nz,1.140.0,4,"I love this game and am addicted. What has happened to the statistics that you used to be able to see if you tapped your character after passing a level eg rank and levels passed in the week, there were 3 different things not just the one shown after each game. Why do you never win the jackpot in the daily game, no point in having it there if you can‚Äôt get it sometimes. Other wise great game"
candycrush,nz,1.140.0,5,Awesome game as addictive as all the candy in it!
candycrush,nz,1.140.0,4,Great time waster
candycrush,nz,1.139.0,5,Great game for those moments when you want some mindless fun. Trying to beat the super hard levels becomes a battle of wills!
candycrush,nz,1.140.0,1,"Gives you hints way too quickly. You don‚Äôt even get a chance to figure out your next move on your own. 
And way too in your face with new challenges. You gotta doin wheels and choose prizes and enter contests...takes you 15 minutes just to start playing the actual game. 
Deleting. This is a mindless waste of time. You are all zombies."

candycrush,nz,1.140.0,5,I love the game so so much the levels are fun and kind of challenging witch is what makes it a good game good job.
candycrush,nz,1.140.0,5,Love the game but do get annoyed with all the ads that pop up constantly.
candycrush,nz,1.140.0,5,Good game
candycrush,nz,1.140.0,5,I love the fact that its like a board game but on a device
candycrush,nz,1.140.0,1,The price increase for gold bars is ridiculous. The price has doubled. I will no longer purchase gold and will find another game. Greedy developers = farewell Candy Crush!
candycrush,nz,1.140.0,5,So fun
candycrush,nz,1.139.0,5,Loves
candycrush,nz,1.139.0,1,"The last update, all that happened was the price for stuff got higher and less stuff for it. I didn‚Äôt mind purchasing stuff before but now it‚Äôs ridiculous and ruined the whole game for me."
candycrush,nz,1.139.0,1,"I‚Äôve been playing for years and currently on 2642 level.
Just very disappointed that I lost all items (about 50 of each type) and some special ones too that I collected by winning challenges and collecting rewards over a long time on reinstall even after everything was syncing with Facebook."
candycrush,nz,1.139.0,2,"After many months of regularly playing, over this week, the Piggy bank is full at 30 bars (rather than 60) for the same price- so it is 100% increase in the paid rewards!! 
And the prices throughout the game have grown!! Yes you are developing the game- but that is CRIMINAL - exploiting our pleasure!"
candycrush,nz,1.139.0,5,This game is in my top 3 favourite game to pass time.
candycrush,nz,1.139.0,5,Great
candycrush,nz,1.139.0,5,Fun easy addictive
candycrush,nz,1.139.0,4,This game is know for being fun and addicting but it‚Äôs also incredibly frustrating. The game is full of colour and joy but the constant ads that pop up (eg. The piggy bank one) get annoying very quickly. Overall you are better off getting one of the knock off versions.
candycrush,nz,1.139.0,3,"Agreed about gold bars. Also it is do annoying that they prompt EVERY MOVE and I can‚Äôt find a setting to turn that off. 
What‚Äôs the point if they are playing the game for you?"

candycrush,nz,1.135.1,1,Double charges purchase options and doesn‚Äôt respond to feedback for refunds. I like the game but continually get double charged for purchases and get no response when providing feedback or asking for help from App Store regarding a refund. Exceptionally poor service and response to taking unwarranted extra money.
candycrush,nz,1.135.1,1,"Hi Candy Crush.

Just writing to say level 435 is actually IMPOSSIBLE to pass on 13 moves when it is supposed to have 25 (yes that‚Äôs right I did my research). So this is something you need to fix ASAP because not only am I true supporter of this app but I literally paid to try and pass and it is still impossible and wasted my poor limited student bank which I‚Äôm actually ashamed about. Once you fix this app I will give you 5 stars but in the meantime you have a very ANGRY customer who is giving you a 1 star although I wish it was a -10 star"

candycrush,nz,1.134.1,4,"Very enjoyable game, would like it if it took less time to move from each level, with less of the graphic things, like leaderboards and weekly races, and if you could open the piggy bank without paying. 

Also more lives would be great"

candycrush,nz,1.132.0,3,"I‚Äôve been playing for years and am a bit addicted, but now all of a sudden, apparently if you press the quit button before playing any moves, it forced you to lose a life!  You used to be able to quit before doing your first move if the board came up and looked like there weren‚Äôt any good moves, so you could try to get a better first board, esp for the tricky levels but now you just lose a life.  Total bs, I‚Äôm so annoyed about that.  Also you should be able to get more gold bars by playing, not not paying.  It‚Äôs greedy."

candycrush,nz,1.129.0,4,Great game and love how much faster it is. I would like to see an option to turn off game hints. Since it's been a faster game it doesn't give you enough time to look at all the possible options. It gives hints straight after you've made a move and id like to turn off the game hints all together.

I suggest, there should be a system where the player can continue playing candy crush from where he/she stops on a new device instead of the player starting all over again after reaching a higher level.
It‚Äôs hurting to start all over after redownloading the game on another device 
Thank you.

candycrush,gh,1.37.0,4,"I love this game. It's really addictive. The only issue I have with this game is that when Facebook friends help you to cross a level sometimes it doesn't take it. So you would have to wait until some else helps you and hope it takes it, or u can pay for it.

candycrush,ng,1.196.0.1,4,The updates makes the game harder. Before now finishing an episode could get you 10 gold bars but now no more gold bars. How are we supposed to be able to get gold bars?

candycrush,ng,1.184.1.2,3,"So far I‚Äôve enjoyed crushing, but I‚Äôm very angry with loosing power ups I‚Äôve gathered. It‚Äôs so annoying. There should be a cloud that saves every crusher‚Äôs data. It‚Äôs really frustrating loosing over 120 power ups just like that. Also, why make the levels crazy hard when you want us to have fun."

candycrush,ng,1.179.0.3,3,It will be so cool if we get to chat with each other in the fantastic 5 and also chat with our friends
candycrush,ng,1.179.0.3,5,Candy crush is simply awesome!
candycrush,ng,1.179.0.3,5,Hi the game u guys create everybody love it and I love you too
candycrush,ng,1.179.0.3,3,"Why are there so many hard levels? I thought candy crush was supposed to be fun but y‚Äôall are making this thing too hard. I was stuck on level 3042 sometime around December, I left candy crush alone and started playing again just this month and found out the game‚Äôs gotten even harder. One would finish a super hard level and the next level is a hard level. This is aggravating and time wasting please fix it. I changed my phone, came back to candy crush and all my boosters are gone. Now you can‚Äôt restart a level without loosing a life and when you lose a level and replay all the extra boosters are gone. There are so many things that need to be fixed I can‚Äôt be wasting my data and time playing candy crush and it is this super hard."

candycrush,ng,1.176.0.2,5,Fun
candycrush,ng,1.176.0.2,1,"You guys sucked the fun out of candy crush!! The ads are ridiculous the levels are harder and the Game is lagging after latest update!!

Sucks the battery at an unprecedented speed. 
It was a good run.
RIP candy crush I played from 2014-2020
Maybe you guys caught the corona
Goodbye"
candycrush,ng,1.176.0.2,1,Your new updates are total trash!!!!
candycrush,ng,1.175.0.4,4,"I hv been a lover of this game for years but recently it‚Äôs been frustrating, why? I could be on a particular level for 2/3 days. It takes away the fun and excitement one is meant to derive from playing the game, pls reduce this harder parts. It‚Äôs becoming harder than real life hustle I was say."
candycrush,ng,1.175.0.4,5,Enjoying my time here
candycrush,ng,1.175.0.4,2,"Before updating the game, I can decide to quit a level if I‚Äôve not made any move prior to that moment without losing a life but now, after starting a level, one life is already lost üò¢"

candycrush,ng,1.174.0.2,1,"This game was designed for fun. The fun was there before not until you came up with this your weekly updates which makes thing far from worst. 
There is no more fun in this game. All that‚Äôs left is hardship if you don‚Äôt fix this and bring back the fun. Then am out of the kingdom. I can‚Äôt be wasting my data, battery and time all at the same time for a game that‚Äôs not worth it anymore."

candycrush,ng,1.172.0.1,2,"The game is very good but why the super hard levels after a hard level . 
Your preview says relax and play candy , what is the essence of relaxing when I will be stuck on a level for about a week. It‚Äôs not like the game has an ending so why the super hard and hard levels.
Your hard levels are too much"
candycrush,ng,1.172.0.1,3,Why can‚Äôt I send my Facebook friends live anymore?
candycrush,ng,1.172.0.1,5,Lovely game all through. I recommend
candycrush,ng,1.172.0.1,1,"Nothing change in the past Four updates, you have to add more features and development, the game going so difficult when continuing"
candycrush,ng,1.171.0.1,2,The most recent update to the app has ushered in a new issue for me where the ad plays for however many seconds it‚Äôs means to play for and just stays on hogging the screen. You can‚Äôt get back to the game unless you close the app itself and start over. A slight irritation in an otherwise cool game. Fix please.
candycrush,ng,1.171.0.1,5,Why..? I‚Äôm so addicted. Why are there no more levels beyond 6455???? Heelp!!!
candycrush,ng,1.170.0.2,5,I‚Äôve been playing level 5569 for a longer time than I expected....please do something

candycrush,ng,1.165.2,5,"Good day!
Please I cannot retrieve my saved progress.
How can you help please?"
candycrush,ng,1.165.2,1,Was really enjoying the game but this new update sucks. You can‚Äôt restart a level without losing a life or boosters. Do something about it please
candycrush,ng,1.165.2,2,The game has become harder and boring since you can‚Äôt restart a level without losing a life and boosters even when you haven‚Äôt made any moves. Poor decision from the developers to do that. People will eventually get tired of playing all together as stages get harder.
candycrush,ng,1.165.2,1,I hate the new update. I can no longer shuffle my own game without loosing a life or booster. Not nice.  Finally a way to stop playing.
candycrush,ng,1.165.2,5,I‚Äôm not happy about the new update on this game.. why can‚Äôt I end and restart a game with out taking my life of the sweet treats giving.. this suck king I need the old update back I‚Äôm currently at 5877 and I‚Äôm discouraged from playing the game.. ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå

candycrush,ng,1.157.0,5,"Hi team, firstly, great work guys! Been playing CCS few years now. Level 2340ü§πüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üòÅ. But I just noticed that it‚Äôs only super sugar crush when one makes the level with one‚Äôs last move but not also if one makes the level after one‚Äôs last move. I think it‚Äôs kinda the same situation so super sugar crush should apply here too. I like completing levels with the highest no of stars possible. Thanks."

candycrush,ng,1.109.0.6,5,"This is a really well made game for some of the reasons I've listed below 

- The world building is excellent, considering all they had to go with was candies.

- The graphics is clean.

- The gameplay strikes a really good balance between being hard enough to pose a mental challenge, and easy enough to play on, safe in the knowledge that you will rise to the occasion.

- It's been well engineered to get you hooked, and that's not at all a bad thing, rather it's proof that a lot of intelligent thought was put in.

a great game of beautiful virtual candies you can't stop crushing."
candycrush,ng,1.106.0,4,"It is amazing playing the the game on my free time.

candycrush,fj,1.14.0,3,"Awesum game, but cud do with sum work..hate being stuck!"
candycrush,fj,1.14.0,3,"I have been stuck on one level for a month but there's no help to move ahead apart from extra lives and extra moves.

The game does not get interesting when this happens and it just kills the interest of the player to continue playing.

Suggest that there be a feature in the game to record/gauge how close a player has come to clearing a level and allow more moves to enable full clearance of candies.  Having to run out of lives and continually request is boring."
candycrush,sg,1.196.0.1,1,Can‚Äôt even play for 2 weeks. Stuck at the loading page. It‚Äôs seems like developer still doesn‚Äôt fix. Uninstall.

candycrush,sg,1.194.0.2,3,"This is a great game. The only downside is that whenever I get a free 1hr boosters or live I have to use it up within an hour. The problem is I might not be able to play during that hour. It will be great if there‚Äôs an option of activating the timer or in exchange for an ‚ÄúX‚Äù numbers of boosters. 

Please be a little more generous with free boosters. As it will make the game more interesting to play."

candycrush,sg,1.193.0.2,1,"After spending 6 days on candy crush. I find it is most idiotic game. I doubt the creators actually played all game  and definitely not all levels. 

The game does indicate the difficulty for every level. After level 500, all levels are very difficult. You can actually spend a whole day trying to finish 1 level. I guess you will need to spend money on it. Do not be surprise that normal level would be Super hard level. You can end up spending days even blowing $20 on still fail."
candycrush,sg,1.192.0.1,1,"I‚Äôve written in to your support to complain of this issue. My candy crush heats up my new phone (iPhone 12 pro max) terribly quickly.

candycrush,sg,1.180.0.1,4,"Candy Crush Saga is a very fun game, and although I like it a lot, it can have a bit of improvement. My opinion on this is that they should slightly change the game up to make it more educational. Candy Crush has a lot of levels, and this game is based on candy. If you want an educational game, this is not the one for you I am afraid to say, but if feel like having a bit of fun, then get this app and try it out!"

candycrush,sg,1.179.0.3,1,"Hi developer, i have been playing this game since college days. Did I miss out something? Where is a confirmation button before you spending gold bars? In a game, if I want to use UFO I press the UFO then it asks me whether am I sure to use it. AKA CONFIRMATION RIGHT????
HOWEVERRRR!!!! after you finished your moves it pops you to spend gold bars or end the game. Sometimes I accidentally press gold bars and heck the game definitely needs more than 5moves to conquer and person of a right mind wouldn‚Äôt use gold bars for it. All in all I just ask for confirmation button before spending gold bars. Thanks"
candycrush,sg,1.177.1.3,1,"There are no chocolate at the left side like others, there is just no way to clear"
candycrush,sg,1.176.0.2,1,Level 190 is ridiculous . Tried so many times n can‚Äôt clear all 80 of each candies in 25 moves . Impossible . Giving up .
candycrush,sg,1.176.0.2,1,"Changed the rules again - basically they just want u to buy their boosters/ or their advertisements.  Shout out to the advertisers, u sure this is your platform?  I am from Singapore, yet I am shown ads from India over and over again.  I am sure just for the viewership.  
To the advertisers, u think I want to watch your ads every 5mins or so?  Instead of being a positive re-enforcement,  every time I see your brand it just screams nightmare!"
candycrush,sg,1.175.0.4,2,"Great of Candy Crush to give unlimited lives during this time when many people are in lockdown, but the levels have also become much easier! Which means players don‚Äôt NEED the unlimited lives and end up quickly getting through all available levels then having to wait days for new ones to be added üôÑ"
candycrush,sg,1.174.0.2,5,You guys actually stuck to your words and updated it every week tho! ü§£ Like I appreciate you devs!
candycrush,sg,1.174.0.2,5,Hero
candycrush,sg,1.173.1.1,5,pls give us unlimited lives during this difficult time. I enjoyed playing non stop! Let‚Äôs crush n get thur this covid-19 together.

candycrush,sg,1.172.0.1,1,I used to love playing on iphone 7 with the vibration effect in the game. Now after the new update the vibration feature is not working and I cannot find any option of enabling vibration. There is no fun without that effect.
candycrush,sg,1.171.0.1,1,Impossible to clear as starting board has 10 missing blocks. Fix your bugs pls

candycrush,sg,1.166.0.4,5,Good
candycrush,sg,1.166.0.4,1,"Too money-minded.  Removing all the bonus for users. From the free boosters to timed boosters. Next, exiting the level when you didn‚Äôt make any moves cost you a life! This is so rubbish! Have been playing for years but definitely boycotting now. The game is deleted from my mobile for good now."
candycrush,sg,1.165.2,1,"Since the reset feature was removed, there is no more fun playing this game as the super hard and nightmarishly hard levels are impossible to clear. And no point wasting money to buy boosters because they are effectively useless when they are often randomly placed on the board by King."
candycrush,sg,1.165.2,4,Facility to navigate to a specific level by specifying the level number will be awesome.
candycrush,sg,1.165.2,1,The game developer decided that they will stop resetting the board when we leave the game (and lose a life in the process). This makes the game very difficult and boosters impossible to apply. Will boycott and delete this game for good!
candycrush,sg,1.164.0,1,"The UI is poorly designed, in the sense that EVERY tap might be you tapping the wrong button and gotta spend your in-game gold bars.

Also, when restarting the game, you will often see a whole bunch of information of in-game events before you can start a game. Very user-unfriendly."
candycrush,sg,1.164.0,5,Devya and her pet likes to play

candycrush,sg,1.162.1,3,Nice game but gold bar suddenly lost
candycrush,sg,1.160.0,1,"The advertisements are just wasting our time. The adverts are so few and hence repetitive. Absolutely terrible! Not to mention, irrelevant ads."
candycrush,sg,1.160.0,1,"We silence our game but when the advertisement pop out, it played the sound.

Please silence all advertisement by default, user can tap on the volume icon to turn on themselves.

It is very annoying."

candycrush,sg,1.159.0,4,Now with the time limit power like coconut wheel for 15mins I don‚Äôt like it. Because sometimes we don‚Äôt have time to play for the whole 15mins and sometimes we have no more lives to play after we gotten the power.

candycrush,sg,1.157.0,2,"Hi, I noticed that each live replenish hourly instead of 30 mins after the upgrade. Is there a bug or this is how the game is programmed now? 30 mins is already too long to wait and now I have to wait for 1hr for 1 live. Appreciate your reply. Thanks!"

candycrush,sg,1.155.0,3,Why update and make the game difficult to clear??? Making new player to give up the game!!
candycrush,sg,1.154.1,2,I still play candy crush but I don‚Äôt like having to be forced to buy the gold pig. So I survive on 1 gold

candycrush,sg,1.154.1,5,I hope the creators take note. I suffer from vertigo and at level 306 and above the candy tiles flash a ‚Äòrainbow‚Äô across the tiles and change. I suffer from vertigo and this caused me to get dizzy. Maybe it affects just me but would be good if they took note or give a warning.

candycrush,sg,1.149.0,1,"please, change the game such that the powerups follow through when switching accounts over to a new phone. all the powerups which i had spent my time and effort collecting were gone on my new phone. when i checked back on my old phone, the powerups were still there. i have no choice but to only play on my old phone as i did not want to waste these powerups. however, that phone was old and the game kept crashing. i had no choice but to delete and reinstall. when i did that, all my powerups were gone. i felt that this is not fair as i had spent my time collecting these to be used next time. i feel that you are responsible for this and that you should make this amendment. furthermore, please take in consideration of the people who use old phones to play this game. the probability of the game crashing could be high, and we are unable to switch to a new account as the powerups will stay in the old phone. i want to see that the powerups will follow when i transfer my account over to a new phone."

candycrush,sg,1.147.0,5,You should update more frequently for the update session
candycrush,sg,1.147.0,1,You can make the game more interesting by giving unlimited amount of lives
candycrush,sg,1.147.0,4,"Returned to the game after stopping for a really long time because I was dead stuck on one stage... Only to be pleasantly surprised that the game has improved tremendously. Definitely easier and more balanced now, although that doesn‚Äôt mean it is no longer a challenge.

I am now at stage 500-ish but I see there is still an incredibly long way to go. How many stages are there in total now? It was still a 3-figure when I stopped playing! 

One particularly painful thing I disliked is the low number of lives and the long waiting time. With the game matured so much, perhaps the developers can consider updating this number?"

candycrush,sg,1.135.1,1,"Don't listen to all the good reviews, heck, most are fake, with only a single word in the review: ""good"". This game is completely pay-to-win, and also preys on players with RNG-based gameplay and utilizes very specific psychological factors to manipulate the minds of players into spending. This has been confirmed, with all the research done about the impact of the game. Do not download, do not support. King has been churning out match-three clone after match-three clone nowadays, all of them pay-to win. That should give you an idea on how bad this ""developer""(more like corporation) is."

candycrush,sg,1.128.0,4,"Been playing since launched. There‚Äôs now the frame upgrade and free 5 lives when you complete the bar. But what good is it for when the max is still five lives? I would not get the free 5 lives at all if I still have lives or playing with free hours! It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm not getting rewarded with a so call reward for playing continuously! Could you please allow the free lives to be added on so the reward makes sense? 

Why is it that I could only send lives to those who are at the same level as I am, which is not many as most people that I know could not reach the level that I‚Äôm in?! I would also like to send lives to my friends but I could not do so as I am so far ahead of them and could not find them! 

I‚Äôm using iPhone or iPad by the way.

Not stated that it's for so few lives. I'm deleting the game - no point playing if I have to keep paying to continue to play - and giving this 2 stars for the developer being something of a cheat."
candycrush,sg,1.121.0,5,This game is very addictive.
candycrush,sg,1.121.0,1,"Hi,

I have been playing for years but I REALLY DO NOT LIKE THIS LATEST UPDATE!!

The ‚Äògolden crown‚Äô stripe goes right across the ‚Äòwhat you need to achieve‚Äô banner & stays there for ages - so if it‚Äôs a timed game you have NO IDEA what you have to do and need to get marching?

The 2 boxes on the right, that now show you your place with Dexter, the spinning wheel (I agree you never hit Jackpot!) and Mort‚Äôs levels, just don‚Äôt work - please put them back where they were. Nothing is clearly shown anymore? Why?

The main reason I am writing this is because I just hit - not sure exactly the level? - 1860 something, and I won 2 free hours - apparently! - but the next game I played I lost, my lives went down to 4 then 3?

I could not find the ‚Äòhours‚Äô anywhere?

I understand that you are trying to improve Candy Crush as much as you can but PLEASE bring back the last version when everything was clearly ‚Äòshown‚Äô and not placed in a ‚Äòcupboard‚Äô for us players - who are ALL on a mission to be the best - to spend our time trying to figure out where my 2-free hours went!!

Many thanks"

candycrush,sg,1.120.0,5,Is there a error in 3160
candycrush,sg,1.119.1,3,"Is the whole thing of controlling how long the game is played by restricting retries bowing to the Cupertino company's desire to take over all semblance of freedom of your iDevice? While this may appease parents, it is plain annoying for the adult in me. There are plenty of other games out there with exactly the same style of game play. Why has this one become so popular? Is it only to do with the social networking integration? I think so. Bragging rights are worth a lot in these days of 'famous for 15 minutes'. Don't let it fool you either. This game is rigged. They have an algorithm in there to make some levels easy to clear after several tries and others that require a few more attempts and it has nothing to do with them being tagged ""hard"" or ""Super hard"" by the game."

candycrush,ie,1.194.0.2,1,I hate this app! My friends uncle got so addicted to this game. Me and my friend begged him to stop. But he refused. A week later he got diagnosed with autism because of this app. (That‚Äôs also what the doctor said). Then he died a week later. Guys stop losing brain cells and play a USEFUL GAME!
candycrush,ie,1.194.0.2,1,It doesn‚Äôt take 30 unskippable seconds to advertise shoes. Guarantees I‚Äôll never buy anything from that place and I‚Äôm playing the game less and less because of this.

candycrush,ie,1.190.0.2,3,"It can get a little boring after a while 
The game kind of takes over and doesn‚Äôt let you do much"
candycrush,ie,1.189.0.2,1,"You have to pay to pass some levels, I‚Äôm on level 30 now and can‚Äôt get past unless I pay, no thanks. They make it fun up to around level 30 than pay pay pay this is one reason I hate free games also known as freemium games, free with a premium lol. 

I‚Äôd rather pay a small sum for a game and have a sense of achievement rather than buy my success it takes the fun out of it.

The worst of it is that they will get people hooked on the game to spend large sums of money  because they make some and possibly many levels impossible to pass without paying. 

I wish Apple would ban this practice , no chance too much money to be made but take my advice don‚Äôt get fooled."
candycrush,ie,1.185.0.1,5,Practise your ability to solve the problem.
candycrush,ie,1.183.0.3,3,"I love this game and been playing eversince its release. However, I don‚Äôt like how it is now especially that I lose a life whenever my other device doesn‚Äôt update the level I‚Äôm in and press a previous level. Whenever I try going back to the map eventhough I haven‚Äôt touched the game, I will automatically lose a life! 30 minutes of waiting for a single life wasted. It‚Äôs funny when it says, swipe match relax; well, it doesn‚Äôt make me nowadays when I press a wrong level and lose a life! Fix this please!"

Too many annoying, impossible levels no matter how skilled the player, you can only move to next level if you pay up for treats or wait and play the level 50 times or more. There are other more satisfying games out there. Will be deleting it if changes are not made."
candycrush,ie,1.173.0.2,3,It‚Äôs a fun game to pass the time but is a total money grab.

The feeling of paying for something I got addicted to freaks me out and I don‚Äôt like it üòñüòí. Gold bars should be free because you got most of our time playing the game.

I have been s player for 6 years but one thing bothers me about Candy Crush And that is the bonus wheel. In all of my six years playing Candy Crush, I have yet to land on the jackpot spot. That is unfair and candy crush is unrealistic in saying that not once can one person land on that spot on the wheel. The reward system has improved generally and there are new ways to earn them but the wheel really bothers me. I‚Äôve now made the switch to ToonBlast as it is a more fair and realistic game."

candycrush,za,1.142.0,5,Great game
candycrush,za,1.142.0,5,Best game
candycrush,za,1.142.0,2,"I enjoy this game. However, it is clear that the game is designed to stimulate the areas of the brain associated with reward and addiction.

It is also clear that psychologically manipulative measures are employed to motivate addiction and spending.

One of the subconscious assumptions about a game is that it is random and fair. However, these games are rigged and manipulated. Again to condition the player to play and spend.

As the above manipulative and behavioural conditioning is not public knowledge, not explained to the player and the player is not even aware they are happening the game is unethical. Additionally, the methods employed are not common knowledge and, even if they were, operate on parts of the brain which tend to over power logical and executive thinking.

King is a listed company. It is driven solely by profit with no regard for how that profit is obtained nor the exploitative methods it used to generate income.

This is not uncommon amongst companies however, government should protect the public. It should enforce or create legislation to prevent psychological conditioning and exploitation. Since it cannot be unknown by government health or monitoring agencies that this is happening, the fact that this game/company is allowed to continue to operate is testimony to the fact that government is more interested in profit than discharging it‚Äôs mandate. A mandate, by the way, awarded to government as a trust.

candycrush,za,1.135.1,5,I thoroughly enjoy playing Candy Crush. It's great fun for all ages.
candycrush,za,1.142.0,5,Best game ever
candycrush,za,1.140.0,2,"Some levels don‚Äôt make sense.  How can you clear 33 jellies and a bomb with only 23 moves, but to get to the jelly, you first have to clear the chocolate, icing, then the holder and then you only get to the jelly.  It‚Äôs like 23 moves to clear 33x4 things and a bomb. You get forced into moves because that‚Äôs all that is available and so you loose moves. Feels like the developer is trying to force you to buy lives and candies etc. Tried one level about 20 times already and still nothing."

candycrush,za,1.139.0,5,"I love Candy crush but at level 1334 you get these spinners that fill your board with chocolate faster than you can play. It really pisses me off to loose the game because of this. How do you get one move to clear 3 candies BUT the spinner fills up 8 blocks? And on top of that it will cover stripped candies so you can‚Äôt use them but when you clear the chocolate that candy is no longer available??? 
Playing is now more of a frustration than entertainment!!"

candycrush,za,1.139.0,5,Game cheats. Lives sent to me by other players once I accept simply vanish.  This is a continuous problem. Also bonuses that I have earned also don‚Äôt show up on my bonus card or in the following game that I am supposed to be able to use.
candycrush,za,1.139.0,1,This level has a bug. The yellow sweets turn to meringue. How are you supposed to complete the level when you take away the yellow ones that we are suppose to be getting! Please fix this bug üò°
candycrush,za,1.138.0,1,Every move dictated and player forced into moves planned by AI developer most probably thinks everyone playing this game is so stupid not to realize the developer is only pushing his sales on app store this is a complete waste of time the game has no use there is no way of planning moves the you have to follow the game it owns you and consumes valuable time by making you believe your playing the game but it actually plays you and your credit card good luck if your so stupid to fall for this

candycrush,za,1.133.0,5,"I really love this game, i feel so relaxed when i play it, a HUGE negative thing i can say is that a person has to wait soooo long for lives, it would be so awesome if it was like Pet Rescue, where you only wait for 5mins and not 25mins for one life and other thing can't you surprise us more with infinity lives like all other games...

When I tried to reconnect I wasn‚Äôt allowed in unless I put in my password and phone no or email address. When I put in the password I was told it was incorrect and I had to make up a new one. I put in the one I have written down in my code book. I was then allowed in but now I have been put back to the beginning of each game. I certainly don‚Äôt intend starting all over again and would rather just scrap all the games - Candy Crush, Candy Crush Soda, Farm Heroes and one other. Is their a way to reset my games to what they were before? Now you are asking me for my nickname and when I put it in you tell me it is taken! Of course it‚Äôs taken. It‚Äôs my nickname,!!"

candycrush,za,1.122.0,5,"Really great game, very entertaining. No complaints."
candycrush,za,1.122.0,2,The newer versions feels like a breeding ground for recruiting new gamblers...  too many fancy psychological tricks to entice you into wanting to spend money in the game... I get that this is the purpose/prerogative of the developers and that some people probably really like this.  But its not for me... I preferred the game when it was simpler with fewer clicks to get around the interface to play the simple game of matching candies.

candycrush,za,1.112.1,5,"I really absolutely love this game, but i feel its unfair when we get a challenge and do not get rewarded when we‚Äôre not connected to the Internet. I understand that challenges work on the internet, but do not allow us to play if we‚Äôre not connected to the internet. Everyday I get my notice from candy crush saying I have full live or times running out and I should play to keep my position. Today when I went to play to keep my position in a certain challenge, I was told that I was at 5th position with a score of two thousand some odd, when I got home and I was connected to WiFi, it told me that I hadn‚Äôt made it to the top in the challenge and it showed me that my score was one thousand some odd. I couldn‚Äôt have decreased because I know that‚Äôs not how it works. My point is, when we‚Äôre not connected to the internet, don‚Äôt allow us to play for the challenges and give us false hope of winning something when we‚Äôre not going to, rather tell us that we should be connected to the internet to win challenges. Beside that, this game is amazing and really addictiveüòä"

candycrush,bs,1.0.11,3,"Awesome game, but need more quest to unlock more levels"
candycrush,bs,1.0.11,1,"My first issue is the option to purchase items. When my iPad is connected to the Internet but the game itself isn't connected and i go to purchase an item the request is denied, but if I request the item again same is again denied, when I click on the item again to purchase I receive the item. The issue now lies with the reiciept, the invoice will have that there were three purchases when I have only received one item. That has happened several times and I have written to King but have yet to hear back from them. Another issue that I have is the fact that when I get a stripped candy and its supposed to clear the chocolate away and it doesn't which hinders me being able to pass a level. That Ish needs to be corrected ASAP!"

candycrush,tt,1.73.0,3,"Candy Crush allows the player to progress to a new episode by 1.) collecting 3 train tickets from one's friends, 2.) waiting for a specified time period, or 3.) paying to progress. When the player collects 3 train tickets (which is supposed to allow the player to immediately progress), the game doesn't always allow them to come through before the specified waiting period is over, in an effort to encourage the player to pay to progress. This can be quite frustrating so beware of this glitch in the rules."

candycrush,tt,1.56.1,1,"I wish I could rate 0 stars for you guys spitefully disconnecting me from Facebook and refusing to sync my account back with it so I could unlock the next levels. People sent me the three tickets to unlock it and how convenient, you all refused to unlock the next part for me and did that. You all are probably going to delete my complaint, because of the big rip off you guys are. I hope one day karma comes back and bites you all in your butts for ripping off your loyal customer and you guys go bankrupt. So you guys refused to give me rewards now huh? I played games and win enough sugar drops to get my rewards yet every time you guys are telling me to connect to the Internet to get it even though I am already connected. Very low of you all and I will be removing the app."

candycrush,tt,1.34.1,2,"Hi guys. 
I'd like to commend you for coming up with yet another illogical, idiotic and biased level; namely 102!!
Who writes these levels for you?? Imprisoned homosexuals???
To employ strategies, one must have a choice of alternatives within their realm of manipulation. 
Not have a deal of fagoty mismatches and even more fagoty timers that are spread apart like a prostitutes legs!!!!
You can't even quit your inane levels and start over!!
You have to self destruct?!!!
And good luck for succeeding getting a massive amount of idiots to actually PAY to play your fagoty game. 
I'd rather buy food for my family and secure their education. 
And one last thing; if the your institutional software writers develop a game where their fagoty game runs out of moves; shouldn't I have my quota of moves restored????

But thanks. 
Your fagoty game helps me pass the time waiting for my kids to finish class. 

Disappointed Engineer who can write a better game if I had the tools and the opportunity."

tinder,au,12.2.0,1,Well guess what.. I had no likes until my gold subscription ran out... The. There was many... Lol...
tinder,au,12.2.0,1,"I was banned... no explanation... no refund... there is no way to contact tinder to ask for an explanation or a refund. 
All it takes is someone to make a complaint and you loose your money and are powerless to do anything about it. Hardly seems ethical to me... ü§î"
tinder,au,12.2.0,1,"I'm mad at myself for getting sucked in! 

Don't waste your time, seriously. The algorithm is completely rigged to force you to pay ridiculous amounts of money for every tiny little function or add-on. 

It actually makes me laugh how much attention this pathetic app gets. 

But I'd say this applies to all the dating apps. You have to remember they're objective is to make a profit off peoples loneliness. There never was not will there ever be a genuine intention to help people find a relationship"

Even if you have a paid subscription, they still bombard you with u wanted notifications. They can not be turned off.
That‚Äôs what happens when your upper management team are clowns"
tinder,au,12.2.0,1,"I‚Äôve used this app for about a year now and I find it to be the most toxic place for some people. You match up with a decent girl but a few days later it proves to be a joke, either they don‚Äôt reply to you or just block you straight up what so ever, without a reason. The amount of people I‚Äôve known who have had this same problem is unbelievable. You either get lied to, lead on then blocked, or not even a single reply.

Overall I suggest if you want to find a decent person, go out and meet people instead."
tinder,au,12.2.0,5,"As a user of this app, unluckily I have really bad genetics which make me look ugly which leads to me not getting any matches even with memberships. I thought a clever way of getting people to match, making a random chat room where two people can talk back and forth between each other based on a persons settings and preferences. Through this chat no pictures are shown until after a good chat the two automatically match allowing to see each other‚Äôs profile. I believe this would be a good feature and would help people meet new people by personality! Please try to get this into circulation of the developers!!"
tinder,au,12.2.0,1,"Honestly I‚Äôm disgusted & enraged at this point
After trying for days to get my account back exchanging emails with tinder I was met with no help. 
I was banned from tinder for ‚Äúlooking fake/like a bot‚Äù. I was unfairly banned, I broke no rules, did nothing wrong, in the end had my time & money wasted, and was met with no resolution other than I can‚Äôt use the app again, until I get a whole new phone & number!
Tinder is a joke!"
tinder,au,12.2.0,3,Fix the quality of photosüò°

tinder,au,12.1.0,2,Don‚Äôt use tinder anymore because it just makes my phone have a heart attack ... it‚Äôs not as smooth running as it used to be

Banned me for no reason lol"
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,"So I paid to use this and they just banned me for literally no reason. 

Idiotic app with no customer service bans you for absolutely nothing other than a stupid algorithm that bans people I correctly."
tinder,au,12.1.0,3,"I‚Äôm experiencing an issue with tinder, I‚Äôm noticing I am getting super likes and when I like them back nothing happens. Is there something wrong with this?"
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,"I got banned out of nowhere, and when I tried contacting them for an explanation, I was given some automated response via email.

When I replied to their email, I received the exact same automated response."
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,I join up. Chat to one person. Organise a date for Friday 8:00. I‚Äôm on tinder for a week. I text the girl on the day to confirm. I‚Äôm banned. No reason for the ban. Matched with 20 people 1 week. Tinder is stupid for not telling me why I‚Äôm banned. There‚Äôs no appeal it‚Äôs ridiculous
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,I cancelled my membership don‚Äôt even bother tinder is so greedy all they care about it getting money for memberships and other add ons beyond a joke not even a dating app just a pointless swiping app!
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,"I have been using tinder for the past 3 to 4 years on and off. I have recently been banned for apparently violating their terms and conditions, I read the terms and conditions and I have not broken any one of them. I have emailed them and again they‚Äôre just coming back with your violating our terms and conditions or we cannot discuss the matter any further with you. How is this fair when I do not talk inappropriately, I have no inappropriate photos and I‚Äôm not a fake person. I have match led with people who have lied about there age and who they are. Not once did I see there profiles get banned. I‚Äôm very disappointed and disgusted with how I have been treated with this."
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,"Like a lot of the other guys here, I‚Äôve been banned with no explanation or reason why. No appeals process so there‚Äôs no way to over turn this or even get a simple reason. Not even a refund on my gold membership at $40+ a month. 

Seems to be a growing trend, regardless of how well you setup your profile or stay politically correct people still seem to get banned. 

Time for a new app."
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,Incredibly slow and laggy. Takes forever to do anything. Constantly freezing. This is the slowest and buggiest app I use by far.
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,"I got banned for no reason without warning, and even after my ban was lifted after thirty days the app is so bugged it won‚Äôt let me login it just takes me back to the home page"
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,Stupid app not worth downloading. Cant even see who likes you unless you download the expensive version. Not worth it. Don‚Äôt bother. I guess tindr is DONE. Bye.
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,been banned off tinder and have no idea why.
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,I loved using tinder by talking to nice people of making a connection and had a great experience on it an I am disappointed a lot of being falsely banned for no reason when they are other users who are going around make up false reports then have them banned for no reason when they haven‚Äôt done anything wrong also I‚Äôm deeply sorry tinder an like to have a chance again
tinder,au,12.1.0,2,"The more matches I get the more glitchy the app is, at this point I can‚Äôt actually open the app without it freezing and when it does get somewhere it‚Äôs so so slow. anytime I try to scroll through conversations the app just closes itself. It‚Äôs beyond frustrating."
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,"Don‚Äôt waste you‚Äôre time on this. Too much effort, too much drama and the ladies of course well known to ghost."
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,This app is a dud.
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,DONT USE TINDER!! Everyone will tell you that they ban thousands of people everyday for no reason!! Especially LGBT people!
tinder,au,12.1.0,2,‚ÄúOops you missed a match‚Äù notifications are annoying. If I wanted to match them I would have swiped right. Get rid of it.
tinder,au,12.1.0,2,"Literally the worst dating app, littered with constant upsells and pleas for you to begin a paid membership. I feel like every month there‚Äôs a new paid-only feature added (pushed into your face) yet the app is still full of bugs and annoyances"
tinder,au,12.1.0,2,I have the latest iPhone 12 Pro Max. Up to date software. The app is extremely laggy. Freezes. Makes it very difficult to use. Cannot click on anything or swipe without it constantly freezing. How is it such a bad experience?
tinder,au,12.1.0,2,"Y‚Äôall need to fix this app, it‚Äôs glitchy, slow and lagging, super annoying."
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,So tricky app and expensive. I hate this app.
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,Unless you are willing to pay a fortune to use a simple app then you will be disappointed. The free app offers absolutely nothing other than to swipe left or right. Once you get a match you are asked to pay the $40+ per month just to see who you matched with. Disgusting!
tinder,au,12.1.0,2,"For an app that‚Äôs been around as long as this one, it‚Äôs surprisingly lacking in features and design refinement. Very little effort has been put into this by the developers."
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,"I understand you need to do ads on free versions but the levels of ads are just getting too much.

My message screen is now constantly taken up with ads to pay to match with people who I have already swiped left on because they are not my type. Why are you clogging up my messages with people who I have already said I‚Äôm not interested in?!"
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,Didn‚Äôt match with any milfs. Quite upset to be honest.
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,"Recently discovered I can‚Äôt select a certain age, now it is an age range of 4 years eg 19-23 is the smallest range I can choose. And on top of that, tinder automatically goes outside of that range intentionally, and I cannot turn this function off. I thought bumble was restrictive, what a joke üòÇ not only that, ‚Äúthis user is popular, send her a super like‚Äù no thanks that‚Äôs an annoying pop up every time."
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,I have never had tinder but I wanted to get it today and my number is banned and I tried asking them for help and they had no interest in helping me
tinder,au,12.1.0,2,"Very regular loser, everyone complaining how slow it is, super likes don‚Äôt work and you do nothing about it because the apps successful. Just because you app is one of the most popular on the App Store doesn‚Äôt mean it runs well. Extremely slow and laggy"
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,"Be very careful if you ever do match. There is a lot of scams. Women not in this country, Australia, or quite probably not even women at all. Just scammers trying to get money out of lonely people."
tinder,au,12.1.0,5,omg money hungry I don‚Äôt recommend and do not download so many upper class people who think it‚Äôs okay to mess around with u just don‚Äôt bother The developer should be ashamed of themselves raising the price by 100% is just uncalled for .
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,They see something they don‚Äôt like they just ban you and you don‚Äôt know why.... it‚Äôs getting pretty bad
tinder,au,12.1.0,2,"Gold and plus are only there to upsell you to ‚Äúplatinum‚Äù... a ridiculously over priced service at $400 a year. 

Don‚Äôt waste your $100+ on this app. Stick to bumble."
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,"The app glitched, I have now lost all my matches new and old and even the people I have been talking to. Which is a little disappointing cause I was talking to some pretty cool people. So I‚Äôm deleting the app."
tinder,au,12.1.0,2,I find that tinder bringing in consent terms and conditions and one of them being our personal information being transferred out of North Korea VERY DODGY.......
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,"The app was average
Then it suddenly has a need for an email account for ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt allow me the option to say no, skip it or delete my account 
Now they are forcing a consent page???
I‚Äôm not sure they understand the meaning of consent 
Pathetic 
1 Star is being generous 

Do yourself a favour and just go out and talk with people instead or use one of the other services

Tinder sells your data"
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,"Poor poor poor effort. For an app as well known as tinder, I‚Äôd expect it to work far better than it does. Every month or so the app glitches out for a month or 2 and it‚Äôs absolutely unusable. My account is a gold account (paid for by a mate) and it‚Äôs unacceptable that you‚Äôre making money off of us and supplying us with a sub par service. I wouldn‚Äôt accept this elsewhere so why should I accept it because it‚Äôs a dating app. Sort it out and get in contact with me or refund my account every penny I‚Äôve paid you guys"
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,Ridiculously expensive app! And really annoying constantly being prompted into buying of them!
tinder,au,12.1.0,5,Met the love of my life xx tinder pay for the wedding?
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,Been using the app for years with no issue and know I‚Äôve been banned for no reason
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,I got banned for no apparent reason and they won‚Äôt do anything about it at all rather quite disgusting when I paid for this app on multiple occasions.. meanwhile there‚Äôs bots and escort services on there that are on there still sigh ..
tinder,au,12.1.0,1,...
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,"If you accidentally hit an 8 instead of a 0, the app will think you were born in 2008 and no matter how many times you reinstall, every time you enter your number it‚Äôll tell you you‚Äôre ‚Äúunderage‚Äù and you can‚Äôt create an account."
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,"Often froze, which resulting cannot open the app to receive message or look photos"
tinder,au,11.31.0,2,"The app is very basic. It presents people further than the maximum that I set in my profile. The kms away from me seems to be way off quite often (distance from my major city instead of my suburb). 

Also people tens of thousands of kms away randomly are shown. Why is that? Weird! 

The photos often don‚Äôt have people in them. Other apps enforce a photo of a person which is helpful but not Tinder. 

I will get a like and when I immediately tap the like notification, it tells me the profile is no longer available. This happens to me a lot!

These things should be fixed and then I‚Äôll give it a higher rating."
tinder,au,11.31.0,2,"the app has recently become really laggy and won‚Äôt load new messages or matches. i get the notifications for new matches and messages but when I go on the app it doesn‚Äôt show, and the main page where i can swipe on ppl isn‚Äôt showing up it‚Äôs just constant loading. this app has so many issues and i‚Äôm sick of it."
tinder,au,11.31.0,2,How come a dating do not allow ppl to send nudes
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,"I dont mind the app itself i think its alright but I‚Äôve had to make 4 different accounts now because each account always seem to get banned without any explanation behind it, and when you contact them to find out why you get nothing more then a auto generated email about tinders ‚Äúterms of use‚Äù its an actual joke the customer service is absolutely appalling"
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,I payed for gold which is absolutely ridiculously overpriced and the past 3 days it hasn‚Äôt gave me any top picks just does the countdown to the next day. When my subscription is up I‚Äôll be deleting it for good
tinder,au,11.31.0,5,Been a gold member for a long time.  Recently was banned for no reason  No refund No reason why.  I want my money back TINDER you are digging your own grave
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,Was anally molested by a trans
tinder,au,11.31.0,3,"Editing can be difficult at times and the age bracket and distance is never accurate plus the very large amount of dodgy/ fake profiles for prostitution and scams is never ending, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be anyone managing the app."
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,I don‚Äôt like how you can‚Äôt even edit you profile
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,"my number has been permanently banned + my facebook for no reason, i‚Äôve never made an account, and they refuse to even tell me why my account got banned ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è terrible customer service"
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,A buggy mess that regularly freezes and crashes. The developers have stuffing for brains. Save yourself the headache!
tinder,au,11.31.0,2,"As the title suggests, the app is great, and I‚Äôve used it for several years - but unfortunately my experience is soured by the plethora of bot accounts that infest the system. 

Reporting seemingly does not help, as you run into the exact same, or very similar account, hours or days later."
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,"well here we go another app that wants money money money

I tried dating on here for 2-3 months using the default free settings and got some matches [1 with my sister ha ha ] and eventually saw one person same day which was truely amazing

things that happened with me on here.

1/ The obsessive texters who live on there phones do not really wanna meet in person.

2/ The ones who never get back to you

3/ The time wasters

4/ The ones that think your not normal because your too nice - really 

account deleted and its back to the old fashioned way to meet real people out in the real world - lol"
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,"I have been using tinder since I turned 18 and suddenly got logged out today, with the notification that I can‚Äôt login for 1800 days. 
This is apparently due to me being ‚Äòunderage‚Äô, but I used the app for over a year with no issues.
And then I find out there is ‚Äòno appeals process‚Äô and nothing I can do for 1800 days.
Absolutely unacceptable."
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,"This app has been extremely slow and glitchy for some time now. It constantly freezes, lags and sometimes messages go missing. I have deleted and downloaded several times (and since upgraded my phone) which does not fix the problem. Please fix this ASAP as it makes such an unpleasant experience - as if dating wasn‚Äôt difficult enough already."
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,"Been using this app for a few years now.. and i can honestly say there‚Äôre so many better apps, tinder is super overrated and only allows for the small minority of lucky people to become more visible to others. It can drive you insane, because no matter how perfect your profile is, and how attractive you look, you‚Äôre most likely to just be in a spot where you don‚Äôt get a match for a week.. the algorithm system is horribly developed, and the people behind it are obviously no experts on how it should all work. I‚Äôve been getting so much more luck on hinge, even though I‚Äôve perfected both accounts, not to brag but many have said I‚Äôm around a 9\10, but looks shouldn‚Äôt even matter obviously, its just my point is no matter how much effort you put into something on tinder it always screws you over unless you keep ip with the ridiculous algorithm such as swiping on people in a perfectly consistenct order.. too many right swipes=you‚Äôre desperate.. too many lefts= you‚Äôre not giving people a chance.. theres not even an in between. 

Anyway, download bumble, hinge or even pure.. they all give you a chance, unlike tinder 

Thanks for reading, have a great day :)"
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,it‚Äôs is being really buggy and won‚Äôt load
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,"Like most dating apps, Tinder is an exploited and impractical application. They will make you pay to upgrade to Tinder Gold in order to match with more ‚Äòhigh-status‚Äô women in your area which leaves men no choice but to pay an absurd amount of $40+ each month. Not to mention its clear bias and unfairness against men, as I have seen first-hand evidence of how a girl can sign up for free and get more than 100 matches but a guy must pay in order to starting matching.

Overall, men should not download this app and save your money on more realistic purchases."
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,"I‚Äôm sorry but you have people that are saying that there age is wrong on the app in their bio, meaning they‚Äôve been using it before they were 18 but I turned 18 2 weeks ago and yet I‚Äôm kicked off because I‚Äôm not of age. How does that work????"
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,"Paid for tinder gold (one month- don‚Äôt judge me) after one day it turned off. There is number to call, no email to message, no online support at all. Pure garbage app. Delete! Delete! Delete!"
tinder,au,11.31.0,4,"This feature is nice to have, and it‚Äôs good to know you can video chat while staying safe on the site without sharing your phone number. BUT having the suggestion box take up half my phone screen while I‚Äôm messaging is SOOO annoying. Also, when I hit ‚Äú not interested‚Äù, the person I was chatting to was instantly unmatched. Happened twice before I realised."
tinder,au,11.31.0,2,"bumble is better, i find it easier to use and you can filter out people with different political views or religions (it‚Äôs good if you want to date within your religion), also can filter out smokers and other helpful things. 
Tinder however, the app is very buggy, basically every few minutes i have to force close the app because it has frozen.
also it ignores the distance range. my distance is set to 40km but somehow i ended up with people over 100km away."
tinder,au,11.31.0,3,Soooooo many fake profiles!!!
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,Can ban you with zero reason and then keep ur premium payments
tinder,au,11.31.0,3,"Currently the app itself is super buggy.
I am having some kind of lag issue where I have to write messages in notepad then copy paste them into tinder it‚Äôs so bad, I have tried everything, please look into this thanks you!"
tinder,au,11.31.0,2,"My account had been hacked and presumably my bio and images had been changed, and potentially even my matches were messaged derogatory things. As a result of whatever had been going on in my account, it was banned.
I logged in to find the message about being banned. I wasn‚Äôt even given a ‚Äòpotential security threat‚Äô warning or something. Just straight up banned. 
I have emailed repeatedly and this has been ignored by your customer service employee JULIA. 
If I‚Äôve reported my account as hacked then I expect that report to be taken seriously and acknowledged. 

Absolute pitiful effort for the members actually doing the right thing, I‚Äôve had my account for over a year and although I may not be an active user, I certainly don‚Äôt use the time I do spend on the app TRYING to get banned. 

An appeals process should absolutly be in place for situations like mine."
tinder,au,11.31.0,3,If I wanted premium features I would get them you don‚Äôt need to keep pushing them at me
tinder,au,11.31.0,3,I enjoyed the tinder app more than other dating apps. Everything was great until I was banned unexpectedly and without a reason given. I went through their terms of service and possible reasons as to why I‚Äôd be banned but none of them seemed to align with what was on my account. This happened just after I deleted my account and re signed back up to reset it too. I have sent through a ticket days ago trying to at least find out why with no response as of yet and a message saying ‚Äúwe may not respond to you individually‚Äù under the subject of bans. No appeal options? Not even a reason given? A bit unfair honestly. I understand there‚Äôs important safety aspects to consider but a reason should at least be given.
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,Even having the latest version of the app on an iphone 12 does not prevent the slowness and significant lag time when using the app. What gives?
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,Having always adhered to the terms & conditions and the community guidelines for the years that I have been a paying Tinder member (even upgrading to Platinum) I was suddenly banned! No one at ‚Äúcustomer support‚Äù can or want to tell me what the evidence is. Am at a complete loss!
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,Every fifth profile is escorts offering blow jobs and more starting from $30. Simply not worth of paying membership fee for this..
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,This is a pathetic site it bans your account for no reason and doesn‚Äôt give you an explanation instead of banning real people you should ban the fake accounts real people don‚Äôt exists so in a way I‚Äôm glad to be banned by a scam site like tinder
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,I got kicked off of tinder 3 months ago for being ‚Äúunderage‚Äù but I‚Äôm 20 years old and tried to get back on by sending the contact team proof of age. I just got the same computerised message back everytime. It has been saying that I was allowed back on in one day since Thursday (it‚Äôs now Saturday). I tried contacting the support team again with the same damn response. Will someone just let me back on please I‚Äôve waiting the probation even tho I got kicked off for no reason because I‚Äôm genuinely 20 years old making me of age to use tinder. Will someone please actually sort this!
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,"Microtransactions everywhere. App is designed to make you need them in order to get matches, plus all the fake notifications too, not a good system. 

Not designed to get you to meet people it‚Äôs designed to pay to match with people so pathetic"
tinder,au,11.31.0,5,"Hello, I am a person who loves and enjoys using tinder app, and I am writing to solve the problem quickly. I bought only one booster on January 8th, but I got an error message and I paid for two. Of course, only one booster was registered and I requested a refund, but it was rejected. I sent an email to the Tinder customer center, but there was no reply. Please solve the problem as soon as possible.
Thank you have a good day"
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,"Glitching and stop answering a loooot, all the time I have to close the app and open again. So annoying. And yes I already uninstalled and Installed again and yea it‚Äôs running on the last version. Tinder is the only one app with this problem on iPhone 12"
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,"Updated to an iPhone 12 pro cause it was so laggy and buggy on my iPhone 8 and it‚Äôs made no difference. 
When it works see so many bios saying message me on ‚Äú__‚Äù cause my app is always crashing so I know it‚Äôs not just me!"
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,"Recently active green dots no longer show, worked fine for a couple of days and now nothing"
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,"I‚Äôve had the app for literally 24 hours and have (somehow) already been banned. I‚Äôm 110% certain i did not violate any of the conditions, which has left me confused as to why I‚Äôve been banned. 
I (luckily) did not pay any money for TinderPlus or Gold, so did not lose any hard earned money. Incredibly disappointed. 
Not even going to bother trying to figure out why I have been banned, as from other reviews, I can tell I won‚Äôt find out the answer. 

And to think I was excited to join the app üôÑ."
tinder,au,11.31.0,2,Used to be minimal but there‚Äôs about 25% fake profiles now and it‚Äôs becoming discouraging to use
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,Theives who are  blindly getting away with it
tinder,au,11.31.0,5,Enjoying tinder but still yet to fine my special someone hope to find that one this year üëç
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,I found love and then my account was banned without exchanging numbers. Tinder destroy lives and break hearts the opposite of what they promote
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,Had been using tinder for a bit just talking to people nicely like u would in person trying to meet a nice girl. Next thing I know it tinder banned for nothing. Try to contact them as it must be a mistake & nothing but a generic response & no appeals process is available at all
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,Pretty sure I‚Äôm permanently banned bc it won‚Äôt let me even make a new account.. even with a different number..? I kept getting banned bc a crazy ex spam reported my account lmao.. they literally told me they did it. Give me my account back ffs. And fix how easy people get banned.
tinder,au,11.31.0,2,New update lags so much
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,The bugs are insane... barely had any matches in years and half the time when I do the app bugs out and I lose a bunch of matches. Then I get emails and notifications saying I have messages but there‚Äôs no messages there. Practically given up on the app.
tinder,au,11.31.0,3,"App crashes after about maybe 10-15 swipes? Also I keep seeing people I‚Äôve swiped left on a few swipes later, is that meant to happen?"
tinder,au,11.31.0,2,"This app used to work fine but in the last week or so, it has become incredibly laggy and the only way to open new messages is to reinstall the app and/or login again. I‚Äôve also tried restarting my phone."
tinder,au,11.31.0,2,"I really love the App. But it's working soo slowly, something wrong with that."
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,Did nothing wrong with no explanation
tinder,au,11.31.0,1,Literally get banned for no reason and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it. Don‚Äôt use tinder until they fix it
tinder,au,11.30.0,3,I wish there was a search option where you could search for specific things like ‚Äúlooking for friends‚Äù or ‚Äúlooking for a relationship‚Äù because it‚Äôs pretty annoying matching with someone only to find out their here to make friends or hookup instead of a relationship and you should be able to choose what nationality you see. Other then these things it‚Äôs a great app that i‚Äôd highly recommend
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,"So the app is broken. Haven‚Äôt used the app in more than 4 years due to issues I had with missing chats with potential dates amd meet ups, at the time,  and now the app claims I‚Äôm banned but it doesn‚Äôt recognise phone number, email and creating a new account is broken not responding. I guess I‚Äôll just keep this as deleted then and just go to a bar to meet someoneü§î."
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,"I got banned out of nowhere with no warning nor reason, I know for a fact i did nothing to get mysef banned since i barely open the app at all. 

Dont bother."
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,I was in an open relationship. Never hassled or approached anyone inappropriately but my account was banned for not following guidelines which I get but now I‚Äôm single again I can‚Äôt log on at all! I emailed you guys as well and just got an automated response.
tinder,au,11.30.0,2,"I‚Äôve noticed since the lag update my tinder has been very laggy and will take awhile to open messages and be able to swipe on matched, I deleted and re download tinder but now it‚Äôs not letting me view any messages and I need to delete tinder to be able to see any messages"
tinder,au,11.30.0,3,I‚Äôm still get matched with men who identify as men. No thanks tinder!

tinder,au,11.30.0,1,"BOYCOTT TINDER UNTIL THEY STOP BANNING USERS FOR NO REASON AND WITH NO PATHWAY TO GET THEIR ACCOUNT BACK!! 

They take your money then ban you. Absolute theft. How is that even legal??"
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,"Tinder has full of scammers. Beware of them. One suggestion for tinder, history of chat so you can report them. Disappears and its hard to get them."
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,"I actually love Tinder, it‚Äôs a good way to see what‚Äôs out there and pay a little extra to see who‚Äôs interested. But I logged on today to find my account was banned for no reason. I emailed and I googled and it just says I have violated the terms of use or community guidelines which I HAVE NOT in anyway. Does not make sense. If someone has reported me, it should come up with a warning saying so, or an email stating why someone has reported you so you can back yourself up. Now I am unable to use this app as they do not do appeals. Disgusting."
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,Says you can be 17+ but locks you out when you put your correct age. Update your information
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,"I had just downloaded tinder and made an account and got banned two days later with no justification. Really slack, the app also crashes heaps... I guess it's time to download bumble."
tinder,au,11.30.0,2,"I was born in 2003 and now i‚Äôm 18 years old,why i still be blocked?"
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,"I‚Äôve seen many reviews and online posts talking about bans. Now suddenly I‚Äôm banned for no stated reason. I‚Äôve been a paid up user for years. I emailed tinder support trying politely to sort it out or at least find out what I had done and I just got a generic refusal. 

This approach to a normal paid user surprises me given the rogues and dodgy profiles that thrive on tinder, for example I was recently set up on tinder and then robbed at gun point. If tinder is so keen to take responsibility for user safety then perhaps it can recompense me for being robbed."
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,"Free tinder is useless. The only date you get is the popup to buy ‚Äúgold‚Äù option. I wish I would have never spent so much time on it. Just pure waste of time. Btw, got many likes; but tinder doesn‚Äôt show them; only asks for money."
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,"This app is an advertisement for escorts, erotic massage, and OnlyFans accounts."
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,"I have been using Tinder only for maybe a month now and thought the app was really good until suddenly my account was banned for no explanation at all. 
I do not mistreat abuse or pretend to be someone I‚Äôm not nor do I behave in any manner that could used for reasons to ban. If I have stepped outside the guidelines by accident by some miracle then a warning would be appreciated so I may rectify it ASAP. 
There a hundred of accounts that use the app for different purposes and I have my own, which is no more than any other account on Tinder. 
I have sent messages to support with no help or recognition of what has transpired so we are at a lose."
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,"I have been scammed and want my money back !!! 

I bought gold and the app keep crashing and I don‚Äôt get any matches at all. 

When I get a match , when I message them , they don‚Äôt get it for up to 6 months. 

I‚Äôve had more than one match prove to me that my messages and matches don‚Äôt go through 

Waste of $50 I want my money back the app doesn‚Äôt work , I will be calling the obdusmen and consumer affairs."
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,"Why does it say that other matches are close but when you ask there 80+ k away?
And why don‚Äôt you girls ever reply to messages?"
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,"It‚Äôs almost embarrassing to write this, I have been ban from a dating app... if that‚Äôs not meant to make me feel like some delinquent then I don‚Äôt know what is...

 I have emailed them because I have absolutely no idea at all what I could have possibly done unless my account was hacked. 

As a consumer I kind of feel like my rights to my own personal information have been violated. If there has been bad or nefarious activity on my account should I not be informed of that?! 

I did enquire once and I received an email stating they do not need to give me a reason and that was it... beyond confused.
 If anyone has any information or similar experiences please let me know any information would be highly appreciated."
tinder,au,11.30.0,2,I like the app but the app keeps offering out of my distance setting. It‚Äôs not just one or two here or there it‚Äôs almost every third profile is too far away. Please fix this or I will go to a different app.
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,Still hasn‚Äôt been updated for iPhone 12 screen resolution. What‚Äôs going on?! ??
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,No matches for weeks
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,"Why is tinder banning people at random? I haven‚Äôt used it in a couple of YEARS, logged on today and it says banned? What the hell?"
tinder,au,11.30.0,5,Love it
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,App is always lagging when typing and sending messages
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,They banned my account for no reason so I emailed them and they wouldn‚Äôt give me an answer or unban me. Disappointing that I can‚Äôt find my one true love.
tinder,au,11.30.0,2,"I find after each time, more and more scammers were using this app.
Sure I‚Äôd get a lot of matches.
On first use I got a lot of dates, but as time passed the owners want more money for less and have no real regard for their subscribers."
tinder,au,11.30.0,2,I don‚Äôt know why anyone would pay $50 a month to get more likes honestly a waste of money at least when it was $20 it wasn‚Äôt so bad
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,"It Use to be good. Within the last year it‚Äôs become terrible. You use to be able to get matches all day/ every day without membership. Even now with platinum and boosts running, you‚Äôre lucky to get 3 people liking your profile. This is insanely horrible. They‚Äôve just made it to a point we‚Äôre you‚Äôre paying $100+ month to even have your profile seen by a few."
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,Honestly I had reset my account one night updated the same bio and photos as the last and the next morning I was banned without even swiping right or left.
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,Unban me I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,So I‚Äôm a platinum paying member of Tinder I‚Äôve had it for a few months I got banned for absolutely no reason. Customer service is non existent. They just don‚Äôt care. My phone number and my device are both banned. I‚Äôve tried to email numerous times and just nothing. They‚Äôve taken from me all my money and not provided a refund. Literally the worst experience ever. I‚Äôve contacted my bank and asked to have the charge reversed. Avoid giving tinder a cent. They will ban you and they will not refund you. I was banned for absolutely no reason.
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,Downloaded this app only had for awhile and got banned from it for no reason took all my subscription money dodgiest app going can‚Äôt even give you an answer
tinder,au,11.30.0,2,"I used this app for awhile and saw that it isn‚Äôt getting me anywhere so I deleted it. Now I got back to give it another chance and the new features are that there‚Äôs a limit to likes. Yay that‚Äôs what we all ‚Äúneeded‚Äù. Getting worse it seems. Nowadays you need to pay to get rejected, it seems."
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,"My friend had his phone stolen and so the thieves got onto his tinder account and someone how got it banned. So every time he went to login in, it has banned it on the person‚Äôs phone. I think they should consider it as it was not him"
tinder,au,11.30.0,3,"Remove that face to face chat, takes up 90% of the screen with chat open. Surely better UX can be applied there"
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,my friend and i were both banned from tinder for absolutely no reason with no way to appeal it
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,"I was chatting with my tinder matches about how old I was which I am 18 years of age. As soon as I stated my age my whole account was banned and tinder didn‚Äôt even bother to issue a appeal to my ban. I paid for a premium service and I was treated with no respect from the contact team. I urge anyone who reads this not to download this app, it‚Äôs a scam for anyone who wants to pay for premium."
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,"Not a good app! Has banned my account because I deleted MY own account. Tinder support are not supportive and refuse to explain why my account is banned when I did nothing wrong to begin with. Such a joke, they don‚Äôt care about their consumers."
tinder,au,11.30.0,3,"Is it standard practice in the coding world to produce applications full of bugs?? 

If so then this app is on point. 

Vanishing contacts from the list, whom didn‚Äôt remove themselves or cancel their accounts. Features disappearing, such as the ability to see people that are logged in. Settings not being adhered to by the app (I.e. showing profiles outside of the set maximum distance)

Not good enough. I paid for a gold membership and there seems to be almost no benefit for what you actually pay.

If I‚Äôm not getting what the app should be providing, a refund should be in order"
tinder,au,11.30.0,1,"Like thousands before me, I‚Äôve been banned without an explanation from Tinder. There was no notification, email or warning. My account was conservative, photos were the usual happy smiles and I was kind and polite to my matches. Honestly, my conversations were appropriate, they were actually boring, the usual ‚Äúhi‚Äù, ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat do you do‚Äù. 

Looks like thousands and thousands of others have been banned. There is no support from the company and you‚Äôll never get your account back.

I‚Äôd say to everyone, delete this app and go to Hinge. A much better experience at Hinge."
tinder,au,11.29.0,4,"Every person should have at least one photo of themselves with out sunglasses and Filter
a full body shot they there sitting standing running walking
 as in the past I have been show photos 
when you meet the person they are nothing at all like the photo 
One of their face with no filter
And then as many other types of photos as they want
Add men should have a photo of their drivers  license or identification card
Just keeping it safe and real.   Ps
live face-to-face should be compulsory"
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"Unknowned banning
Nothing bad or discriminatory said
No reason as to why
Reset account for 1hr and banned without reasoning"
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"I was banned for no reason. I‚Äôm 18 and just decided to get an account. I even verified with the facial app. I had one conversation with somebody that was good and one I had to unmatch with for sending me inappropriate invites to hang out. And another guy who was creepy. 
I didn‚Äôt have any inappropriate pictures and kept my texts polite. There is no way to appeal the ban so I will be deleting the app and recommend that no one installs it."
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,No customer service but yet will take your money. Also banning people for no reason
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,I have been banned for no reason!l yet you continued to take me money for two months before I knew I had to cancel it. Pathetic!
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"Was recently banned from Tinder, They stated I was pretending to be someone who I wasn‚Äôt when I have both verified phone number and email. Sent them a message they don‚Äôt wanna know about it. Everyone to bumble I say"
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"First of all, I want to preface this review by stating that the app in and of itself, is rather user-friendly. It‚Äôs become a lot less buggy and a lot more stable, however that‚Äôs about where the accolades stop. 
My account has been banned for over a month now and I am still yet to be notified of the reason why, as I keep coming up short.
I have had numerous ‚Äúinteractions‚Äù with Lauren and Jesse from Tinder, however I use the term interactions VERY loosely as the responses I get are simply just the standard, templated, and robotic responses. I have even tried to reach out to Tinder and Tinder AU on Instagram, but to no avail, in the hopes that an actual person would take a look into my account and see that there should not have been any just cause for banning my account. 
The app itself, great. The customer service experience, however - absolutely shocking and poor. Not to mention the fact that for the amount of time this app has been around, Tinder still does not offer an appeals process for banned accounts. So basically, ‚Äúif you‚Äôre banned then too bad, bye‚Äù. Biggest joke."
tinder,au,11.29.0,3,"Also, if we could not have it trying to sell us tinder gold just by scrolling to see the top picks at the bottom of the list that would be great"
tinder,au,11.29.0,5,"Who said you can‚Äôt find true love on tinder? Because I definitely found my soul mate. ü§ç

Wonderful app, Would recommend!"
tinder,au,11.29.0,5,"Tinder is becoming a company that is both for the one night stand, and mid to short term relationship.

Revolutionary. IMO.

To point out that fact that they are cashing in much too quick by raising prices & charging $60 for the ‚Äòplatinum‚Äô account - well they ought to raise capital someplace else."
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,Banned for no reason. No help from tinder they just send an automated message. Seems this happens a lot.
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,I was banned. Not given a reason. All my conversations are PG. I had a great connection with a guy on there and it‚Äôs lost. I‚Äôm extremely extremely p@ssed off
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"I accidentally put in 2008 instead of 2000, and now the app just refuses to work. I contacted tinder and the people just said we can‚Äôt do anything because we don‚Äôt want to. I didn‚Äôt break any rules or do anything wrong at all, all I did was accidentally put the wrong date in and now I‚Äôm banned for 10 years."
tinder,au,11.29.0,5,Can you remove that please? I know how to swipe left and swipe right and swipe the hell up! I don‚Äôt need to be asked every time I open the app if I wanna change my swipe to a dam superlike
tinder,au,11.29.0,5,Yea I wanted to get verified that‚Äôs all you know ü§£
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,This app is a waste of time.
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,Deliberately glitchy forcing you to purchase extras
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"Been a Tinder user for 4+ years prior to this review.
Before Aug 2019, Tinder Gold costed AUD $120 yearly. After that, it‚Äôs now AUD $220 yearly.
It gets worse - Tinder Platinum, the newest premium offering and the highest tier of premium, is a whopping $330 yearly. It‚Äôs also worth noting that the pricing also changes depending on your sexual orientation and preferences - heterosexual guys having to pay the most and heterosexual women pay the least.
I get that being under Match.com you need to make a profit, but this is ludicrous and a straight up scam."
tinder,au,11.29.0,2,"Purchased a 6 month Premium Membership to avoid Ads and Pop-ups. How-ever I still got ads and annoying pop-ups that I had no control over.

Send a message three times with screenshots included, asked exactly what $163 delivered to me with no response. Basically a Scam. Did not deliver, false advertisement and no customer care."
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"So many fake files on tinder 
So sick of it"
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"no tech support what so ever, stop banning accounts for no reason"
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"Today the app got deleted twice 
Then I had to re install"
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"For the last few days the app has been showing me people outside of my age range (on both ends) and it‚Äôs been showing me people over 2hrs away, which is much further than my 40km radius. Not helpful!"
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"The new update is horrible. Roll it back, it worked fine."
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"While the app is great, I can‚Äôt use it anymore as my account was banned for no reason. This also didn‚Äôt just happened to me but happened to several other people I know both male and female. All on the same morning in seperate cities/towns. There is no way to appeal the decision."
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,They band me for no reason also dumped me to talk with Apple for refunds. No any information from them.
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,This is the worse app for getting banned for no reason I know heaps of people including myself who have been banned and have not done anything breaking the policy‚Äôs all your really doing is getting less people to use your app and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the point. If your going to ban people sure but only if there‚Äôs a proper reason with evidence and it should only be for like 3 months or something like banning people‚Äôs numbers forever just gives you less users.
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"MONTHS ago, I was blocked for no reason. 
Just a bot response saying I violated an unspecified rule (even though I hadn‚Äôt recently messaged anyone). 
Still awaiting a human to respond and show me a screen shot or some evidence of any transgression. 
Use other apps.  Don‚Äôt waste your time."
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,Been using it for a bit. It was nice until I just got ban because apparently somehow I‚Äôm under 18??
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,I have had nothing but issues with tinder. And then my account gets banned for no reason. I haven‚Äôt set any photos for nudity. Why has this happened
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"I got banned on my phone (was paying for tinder gold) for something completely ridiculous, a while later my mate tried to log on to his tinder account on my phone because his phone died as he was meeting a date, and his account got banned instantly. I find it completely absurd how you go out of your way to permanently ban users. The lack of ban reviews is disgusting and I would rather pay for another dating app. Not to mention the recent doubling of your prices for a service with absolutely no customer support is quite sad.
Hope you fix this mess soon otherwise you will loose a lot of money."
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,Useless app. My account was deleted without the reason
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,I have been banned from tinder. I at no point was disrespectful to anyone in anyway. I did not once send any lewd pictures. There is no way of asking for a review or explanation. Tinder you need to have a good hard look at yourself
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,Whenever i start i get new likes in an hour and after likes are over tinder suggest to buy likes then when I bought likes and swiped hundreds of people buy not a single like because tinder hides and again suggests to pay more money for getting top for likes. It‚Äôs a scam and cheating app.
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"The app is better value if you don‚Äôt pay for it. Once you pay it puts you to the back of the queue so you have to also pay for boost, you get more matches when it‚Äôs free."
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"This app bans you if you get reports and sometimes people reporting you haven‚Äôt even talked to you or matched with you. You need to sort out your support and contact system, this is low."
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,Won‚Äôt send email code to my phone
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,Must‚Äôve upset someone or got hacked unable to log back in anymore. No help from Tinder at all to recover my account or use my number to create a new account
tinder,au,11.29.0,5,"so much to say for such an addition to an alrady very happy life
this apication has got me onto so many nice adventures 
connections and some very profound experiences surrounding love friendship and sharing times 
i cannot emagn my life without it
biiiig thumbs up!!!"
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,Worst
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,Why well when I went on there I said one thing and a banded me I think I got hacked that show your detailed to anybody so they know where you live I know what you called  phone numbers and more. The worst thing that could happen is risking peoples lives I recommend not to use this app thanks for reading
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"Customer support is terrible.

My friend got banned for no reason, customer support never gave a reason. Paid subscription went unused and expired.

Gone are the days when people used to actually talk to their matches anyway... welcome to the age of useless gadgets."

tinder,au,11.29.0,1,Not only are the prices increased but the amount of fake profiles on here and lack of support makes this app the worst!
tinder,au,11.29.0,4,"While I‚Äôm getting a good amount of engagements, I really wish I could filter people I see by interests, especially because I don‚Äôt want to date any single parents and I want to find those who like anime more often."
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,I paid for a subscription and then posted a pic of myself as a cowboy with what was clearly a toy gun. No weapons so deleted !? I guess? Idk as they don‚Äôt tell you why they blocked or deleted you. I‚Äôm never rude to women. I‚Äôm a gentleman. I paid and then they cut off my service!!! THEFT!!!!!! No reply to discuss either. Avoid this app! They will take your money then not give you the service you paid for.
tinder,au,11.29.0,4,"9/10 app but would love more filters added to narrow down your Match possibilities. ie, race, weight, height, Vegan or not"
tinder,au,11.29.0,2,"Hey there. Looking for a dating app where you can pay for a subscription from multiple options instead of just through iTunes? I am.

Honestly annoyed that I can‚Äôt pay for a subscription because my phone is locked out of making purchases through iTunes over the ‚Äúfree‚Äù category. Would be nice to have an alternative to paying for a subscription instead of depending solely on iTunes."
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"Just as you will find many others saying, Tinder continues to ban accounts at random for no reason but even more frustratingly they offer no appeals process and any emails are responded to with a generic cut and paste reply. You have to get in touch with apple just to cancel a membership üòÇ"
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"I can‚Äôt see messages from people, it says photo unavailable with a paper plane at the top corner, impossible to have a chat with people with this problem"
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"Apart from all the fake profiles, I now put the in correct DOB says I‚Äôm 2 years of age, so now can‚Äôt access the site as I‚Äôm not 18 years old. I can‚Äôt reset so now locked out until I turn 18 which is according the the app not for 16 years"
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,I accidentally put 2003 instead of 2001 and now tinder won‚Äôt let me on it how can I get them to fix it? Or can u guys fix it for me please
tinder,au,11.29.0,2,"Every time I get a response from someone I have to log out and log back in every single time to get a message. The app freezes. Get notifications but nothing is there

still having this problem incredibly frustrating"
tinder,au,11.29.0,2,This app has been gradually going downhill and has a pretty trashy algorithm. How do matches significant reduce as time goes on? Have to constantly restart an account to get anything.
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"Disappointed that I keep getting matches for thousands of miles away. I understand that there may not be matches in my allocated km‚Äôs but thousands of miles away is frustrating. 

Also I think you need to have a ‚Äúdefinition‚Äùpage in your settings. What each symbol means, I‚Äôm constantly googling to find out things. Google often does not have updated solutions or comments with the app changing so much. 

Anyway I‚Äôll give it till the end of my month term and then probably stop it. 

Thanks for the opportunity to make a
Comment."
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,On Premium tinder - when you swipe left on profiles it keeps coming back to where you can see who swiped on you.
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,I had tinder for two days. I only got to speak to one person and then all of a sudden my tinder got banned for absolutely no reason. At least give us a proper reason for being banned or an email address to contact to find out why. It‚Äôs not fair at all.
tinder,au,11.29.0,3,"I have a feeling tinder shadow bans its users even when they are loyal customers who regularly make purchases! 
I only ask for my acc to be seen by people I swipe to.

Cheers."
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"As to my experience using this tinder app, I feel that most profile I chat with are fake or are employees of tinder. Would really like to see my opinion turn out to be wrong. However I am sure I am right"
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"This app has lost the plot. Full of fake profiles, people advertising escort websites, Asian profiles dealing in currency or share scams or fake profiles saying to chat to them on Instagram or Snapchat. 

What‚Äôs Tinder‚Äôs response? They want us to Report these profiles. How about you at Tinder verify new profiles. Why have a location setting if Tinder will show people outside your setting? Why swipe left only to see the same profile a few days later."
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,Been liking the same 20 people for the last 3 days regardless of where i am in Melbourne. Super likes and normal likes don‚Äôt work at all. Can‚Äôt delete my account to start over either. Cheers tinder
tinder,au,11.29.0,3,"i‚Äôve had problems for ages with getting messages but when i click onto the chat the disappear.

i‚Äôd also like the option to choose our own spotify artists as it often messes up and puts up my most recently listened to artists, not top. it also tends to put a spotify anthem for me even when i‚Äôve put my own or put no anthem."
tinder,au,11.29.0,2,"The app is completely dysfunctional. It crashes instantly every time I open it, so I need to then open it a second time, but then it inevitably lags, freezes and crashes. I have to use the desktop website if I actually want it to work. I have Gold but the ‚Äúlikes‚Äù interface is useless. What is the point in knowing I have thousands and thousands of likes but the only way to sort through them is to manually scroll through (on desktop, there is no chance of this working on the app). There NEED to be filtering options, such as oldest to newest, age specification, distance, recently active, interests, etc. In addition, when clicking on people who have liked you, it should automatically show you the next person, so you could swipe through them rather than having to click on every single individual profile. If I swipe left on someone who has shown up in my ‚Äúpeople who liked you‚Äù, I do not want to be shown to them again. There have been people who I have swiped left on SIX TIMES, but they just keep liking me and clogging up my likes feed. The video chat pop up is also very annoying."
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,the app is so laggy!!! fix it
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,Most profiles are all fake people. That‚Äôs why no one talks to you when you match. If I could give it zero stars I would.
tinder,au,11.29.0,1,This billion dollar industry sure has the algorithm working...for them to make money and not deliver. Continuing to figure out more ways to take advantage of vulnerable singles. Industry needs reform and local governance ASAP before more people get killed and attacked

tinder,au,11.29.0,1,"If you are over 40 and a genuine guy don't even bother with Tinder, it's a total RIP OFF! Go with E-harmony instead.
They take your money, give you about a months worth of ""activity"" then ghost you. 

Oddly, or not, most of the women over 40 on there have been on Tinder for several years, which is what Tinder actually want so they keep getting their $. At the end of the day why would they want them to find a partner? Tinder is for fools! Honestly, I've been on there half a dozen times in the last few years and after a month get ZERO matches and ZERO likes and I can tell you it's not because I'm ugly! 

AVOID!"

I think Tinder should have feature what‚Äôs called ethnics it would make it easy for a guy or woman to meet like for example. Filipina girl in Australia, Lebanese girl in Australia, USA girl in Australia, Chinese girl in & British in Australia. This is just an example I‚Äôm asking it would make so easy if you can add the feature ethnics. Instead of seeing one girl you don‚Äôt like and you press nope. Other than that I enjoy this app."

tinder,au,11.28.0,1,"I have been using Tinder on and off for a little while. My account was recently banned out of nowhere. I am certain that I did not violate any policies, yet my account was banned without giving any explanation. Tinder doesn‚Äôt have a resolution channel, since I assume it is cheaper to sacrifice a minority of wrongfully banned users than actually having people to assist its customers. I am in no way a unique case. I understand there are cases where a ban is well deserved, but even then an explanation or a warning should be offered beforehand.

TL;DL
Your account could be banned without cause. Tinder has no resolution channel leaving you out of pocket. Think twice before investing any time or money in the platform."
tinder,au,11.28.0,1,"very disappointed, downloaded it for the first time and as soon as i went onto the app it came up that i was banned!!! definitely getting all my friends to delete this app and already got most of them to!! and they had the audacity to ignore my email about it, how unprofessional ü§Æ"

Global Search is a big issue. You start to speak to someone who is 5 km from you then  you find out they are several thousand km away, even in a different country. Since there is a global search option there should be a choice to not pop up in other people‚Äôs global search if there original location is outside you distance setting 
Stay with the free dating apps"
tinder,au,11.28.0,1,"Signed up premium membership , invested a bit time and had some good options and then my app stopped working, couldnt log back on  :("
tinder,au,11.28.0,1,"I see the same people come up on my feed regularly, which is a bit of a time waster. Also, get a separate app for couples - I don‚Äôt want to date you and your girlfriend lol"
tinder,au,11.28.0,1,"Constantly glitching and support never responds , even if you‚Äôre a paid subscriber."
tinder,au,11.28.0,1,"Basically, i got banned from Tinder for being 19 years old and out of nowhere I can‚Äôt access to my tinder account anymore. They told me that i need to be 18 to be able to used Tinder but like i‚Äôm 19 with all the information that i have been provided including my ID . I don‚Äôt know where the got the age of me being under 18 years old from. Now I can‚Äôt even delete or create another account because i only have one phone no."
tinder,au,11.28.0,1,"Looking at the reviews, it seems like this is an increasing trend. I used the app for a year, took a two month break, signed up for gold again, was on for a week, got banned, lost all the money. No explanation, no reason, no warning, no breach of the terms or guidelines. At the time, I was only matched with one person and the only message I‚Äôd sent was just a few notes about myself. Don‚Äôt know if I was reported, don‚Äôt know if they just cull accounts. I‚Äôm out serious cash and have lost an avenue to finding someone new after losing my wife to cancer. I‚Äôm devastated by this..."
tinder,au,11.28.0,2,"They‚Äôve done an update and it‚Äôs glitched out completely. I can‚Äôt access any of my matches or see their messages despite the chats still being up it‚Äôs giving me error messages everywhere. And despite that still somehow managing to push me to do a video chat with everyone. 

Up until recently it‚Äôs been pretty damn good"
tinder,au,11.28.0,1,Don‚Äôt get me wrong l wish l could give it five stars but for some reason tinder isn‚Äôt working and my pervious messages isn‚Äôt popping up in the actual conversation
tinder,au,11.28.0,1,"I don‚Äôt want to be prompted to super like when I swipe right, this is so unnecessary and annoying I‚Äôm going to delete the app if it‚Äôs not taken away"
tinder,au,11.28.0,1,"Banned for reason please Un ban the accounts ,

Otherwise this app should be flagged and taken down"
tinder,au,11.28.0,1,Literally banned for no reason woke up one day and was banned real mad about it lol
tinder,au,11.28.0,1,Got banned for not reason at all. Stupid
tinder,au,11.28.0,1,This app consumes lots of battery and my phone gets hotter. Please fix those issues.
tinder,au,11.28.0,1,"Asks if you want to upgrade your like to a super like every 15 seconds.

 No. I don‚Äôt. Stop asking me."
tinder,au,11.28.0,1,"Since I‚Äôve changed phones, I need to keep deleting the app to be able to read new chats and notifications. Very annoying."
tinder,au,11.28.0,1,"Got banned for no reason, useless customer service, just said I violated guidelines when all I did was log into another device."
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,"You‚Äôve been outed for doing absolutely nothing to help or protect people who feel, or are threatened or harmed by people they meet on this app and your miserable pathetic response is to make a link to Lifeline?! A free nation wide counselling service that has absolutely nothing to do with, and is not supported by Tinder in anyway shape or form. You honestly can‚Äôt even be bothered helping all these people you feed off. Yuck."
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,This website contains a lot advertising fake people and spam
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,Spending hours going through the troubleshooting menus trying to cancel my subscription with no luck. It tells you to cancel your subscription in the browser but in your browser it tells you to cancel it on the app which is impossible. This should be illegal
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,The females all of a sudden think it‚Äôs their time to get some Greek god of a man. They match just to get there own confidence boost not to actually talk to you.. or even use the app for what it‚Äôs ment for (dating) not selling your homemade porn or to build up your Instagram followers
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,"My account got banned for some reason. They won‚Äôt tell me why, I can‚Äôt appeal it and I had over 3 months left on my tinder gold subscription that I can no longer use. To say I‚Äôm not happy is an understatement"
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,"Very dodgy and glitchy app, it could use more than a few updates, the bumble app is very similar to this and had little to no bugs, see you guys there üòÅ"
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,"Don‚Äôt waste your time, once you‚Äôre banned there‚Äôs no going back. Rude staff, lack of professionalism. Lads and ladies- its time to meet people in real life. Get off this disgusting app and meet people."
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,After signing up for an over inflated price due to my age bracket my account was then banned for no know reason. On top of that Tinder has no support to find out why this was done. They don‚Äôt care and are simply happy to take your money and give zero support. Do not use this app. It‚Äôs a waste of time.
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,"Tinder used to be good just as Uber eats used to do be good but now that they‚Äôre popular and successful enough... they can get away with disgusting practices.

From just simply leaving you in the abys in terms of their matchmaking algorithm system... to pressuring you into buying more super likes because that user that you‚Äôre going to like is a ‚Äòpopular user‚Äô hahahah (that‚Äôs a new one). 

I have noticed much less exposure as a free user and the gold subscription is also now roughly $50 AUD (MONTHLY) which is absurd.

There are better online dating apps today definitely and I‚Äôd say Tinder is on its last legs."
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,"Most of the ladies are in overseas and your site is showing these people as they are our next door neighbors ,,, that‚Äôs why the level of the scam is high..."
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,I do not recommend tinder as My account was randomly banned when I did nothing wrong. Common issue
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,Not possible to use in this update! Fix the app please
tinder,au,11.27.0,5,Thank you for such a practical and user-friendly app
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,"I have used tinder for a significant amount of time, today I log on to find my account has been banned for a ‚Äòviolation‚Äô of the guidelines 

I have never breached any rule and I am a prominent person in the local community in an executive position - to

Tinder cannot even tell me what the violation was - I explained that I believe then it must be a private or I‚Äôve been hacked"
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,I found Tinder a total waist of time. I signed up over a 3 years ago and not even 3-4 weeks into it my account was blocked. And still in till today. No idea why! I tried setting up a new account but because my details are of an existing/past user I‚Äôm not allowed to re-sing. I messaged Tinder but never heard back from anyone. I recommend everyone try Bumble it‚Äôs fun easy to use and it‚Äôs FREE.
tinder,au,11.27.0,5,I would like more real matches üôÅ
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,"Advice to everyone would be don‚Äôt pay for any upgrades, your account can get banned permanently for no good reason, and there‚Äôs no dispute resolution process. Leaving you out of pocket for an app you can no longer use."
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,"I‚Äôve redownloaded the app, tried using data over wifi, every single thing they suggest, but my options are the same ten people when I swipe and no matches are occurring, I supposedly have 49 messages and none of them are showing."
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,"When just register there will be a lot of likes, after pay for month subscription there was just a couple of likes from fake accounts registered overseas. Do not recommend this service."
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,"I have been using tinder for 3 years, which I have got golden membership in my account with more than 450 super likes stocked which I haven‚Äôt use. I could be a very regular user for the app, and during the using, I have not even abuse anyone for language or attitude. But suddenly one day I received msg that my account has been banned cuz of I against policy???? If I match someone I am super nice and easy going chat and running conversation, compare with most of ppl there just ask meet up, I am much appreciate with each person.
Very disappointed result on this app, I have no idea of any other has the same or tinder just want people pay them and give you no reason and kick you out."
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,I can‚Äôt delete my account and make a new one. First of all my account doesn‚Äôt delete so I try logging out and making a new account but because my phone number is the same it just logs me back in. I‚Äôm so annoyed I‚Äôve tried on mobile and pc to delete it. This is just unreasonable!
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,I just downloaded tinder and for some reason my number was already banned even though it‚Äôs never been used for tinder. I‚Äôve heard many people have been banned for no reason it‚Äôs quite disappointing to be honest and they losing a lot of customers I must say overall worst dating site customer service is absolutely terrible don‚Äôt even bother with this app
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,"since the new update, i can not see new messages but receive notifications for them. the only way to solve it is to uninstall and reinstall, which is really frustrating"
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,"I logged out of tinder to then sign back in a few days later & my account got banned, this app is horrible if I can‚Äôt , 1- make a new account or 2- log back into my original account,
To be banned for doing nothing against the rules of the app is insane"
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,"Tinder is full of weirdos, ugly Chinese, transgenders, scammers and fake profiles. 
I see lots of guys complain about having been banned for no reason. There is a reason and that is women are nasty and when they unmatch you they report you too!  That‚Äôs what you should too at least you feel better ha!"
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,"My account was spontaneously banned for no reason at all. I had a number of matches and hadn‚Äôt yet sent any messages. My photos were appropriate.
Tinder is a sell out application only after your money."
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,"I had just bought boosts and then the next day I‚Äôm banned, they won‚Äôt tell me why and won‚Äôt let me access my account or start a new one"
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,Useless app the women never respond to messages they all have massive egos
tinder,au,11.27.0,2,"All this app does is fuel women‚Äôs ego‚Äôs most of them just play games with boys and compete with their friends to see who can get the most matches.

The average looking guy gets 1-3 likes a day on average, while and average looking girl gets literally 99+ a day.

I have conducted experiments with my female and males friends and this case is the average for each gender of my age (19) 

So all this app does for me atleast is lower my self esteem and make me feel undesired"
tinder,au,11.27.0,1,So Tinder thought it would be a good idea to add this feature where they limit your likes to force you to pay..... so to avoid trashy women  I might just opt out.
tinder,au,11.26.1,2,One too many bots
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"Been on and off tinder for the last 12months 
I come across nice people and some people with questionable characteristics... I will delete my profile from time to time and sign back up. I went to login in the other day and it said I was banned, but for what reason? No reason. Only thing I can think of is a delete my account too often. But the reason is ridiculous."
tinder,au,11.26.1,2,Why can I no longer see dates and times for messages sent by me and the other people?! So hard to keep track on this app anyway without simple basic information being available.
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,I can‚Äôt send anything.
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"I don‚Äôt know why I was banned, I believe that a male who met me may have got me banned as he was hurt I never replied or talked to him after meeting. No way to appeal this either."
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,Too many fake profiles
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"Watch out if your a paying customer, you‚Äôll be banned for no reason.
Then they can‚Äôt provide any details as to what you‚Äôve been banned for!
Useless app!"
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,Getting banned without any reason or explanation explained. No probation period of time no warning just straight up banned and not even told why.
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,Waste of $‚Äôs & time. Full of fake accounts. Caused more problems than it solved.
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"This ap is geared to make money.  Not help people find each other while making money. 
If you‚Äôre a guy, forget it.  Any honest and experienced female user will tell you, you‚Äôre off to a bad start just by being male. 
Prices are a joke and the boosts are fictitious.   So they withhold matches on purpose so you have to boost and stupid prices.  
Never again!!!

Trust is gone."
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,Paid for a subcription and got my account supended for no reason. Can‚Äôt even contact the customer service
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,When comparing this to other apps why you have to wait for a match is rediculous just show who‚Äôs available and implement a block option and remove the matching limits and fund it with ads
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"Because Tinder has refused to provide details of rapists to Australian authorities, I will never use this app again!

Tinder‚Äôs lack of action on this matter means Tinder is enabling sexual assault in Australia!

That is NEVER ok! I wish I could give 0 stars!!!

I got an email to say ‚Äúuser safety is a priority‚Äù. If that was true Tinder would hand over the information to authorities regarding the accused rapists that have recently been in the news. Until that happens I will not have anything to do with Tinder and I do not approve of your team emailing me to follow this up again either!"
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"Got banned without warning, without any sort of reason. Just ‚Äúhey youre banned for life, get a new phone if you wanna use us‚Äù. Customer support is lacking very much, it takes you to be a star like james charles to get unbanned for the ban for no reason."
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"Numerous fake profiles - recently reported someone trying to catfish with fake photos only for them to get me banned with false complaint. Have been paying member for years always followed terms of service. Received no support, just continued generic response and no appeals process. Additionally they employ discriminatory pricing practices based on your age and gender. Tinder needs to up their game. Don‚Äôt waste your time with this app."
tinder,au,11.26.1,4,"Free version is literally pointless, membership shouldn‚Äôt be so expensive"
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"Was a paying subscriber, used the app for a long time. Log in one day account is permanently banned. No reason. No explanation no customer support, their isn‚Äôt a way to talk to the customer support team, every email reply is just automated
Really hope they realize what they‚Äôre doing. Go online and google tinder banned for no reason and you‚Äôll see thousands of paying subscribers have been banned. They need to fix this"
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"So was using it.. not all the time but I dabbled. 
And one day I log in and they said I‚Äôve been banned. No reason or anything just plain banned. 
I emailed and ask them for a reason they said I broke the conduct. And I asked how since I‚Äôve been a user for a while and this is news to me. And said I wouldn‚Äôt do it again. If I know what I did wrong. 
Nothing. 

Horrible for someone who‚Äôs paid premium and been a long time user."
tinder,au,11.26.1,3,"i have no idea why, but my account was banned. i pay for tinder but now i can‚Äôt use it and i have no explanation why.. please help"
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"Too expensive for a dating app that barely works. 

Always crashing. Glitching constantly."
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"This is serious!
Tinder allows Rapists to meet girls, rape them, then ""unmatch"" or delete all chat history !  Girls then think they have no proof or photo of the guy to take to the Police. 
If you complain to ""Tinder"", you'll get a generic response and nothing more. This allows the rapist to keep doing it over and over again!
Tinder is being sued by many people but they make BILLIONS of dollars, so they don't care and will ignore complaints and carry on with business. 
The business makes you keep paying, that's the business model. 
Make money and don't help victims of rape or the Police, when they want information. 
This is absolutely OUTRAGEOUS !
Watch Australian ABC show
 ""4 Corners"" and you will see the truth. 
Australian police have been trying for years to get information about rapists but Tinder doesn't want to help at all. 
You've been WARNED !!!!!
TINDER is a gutter App, keep away!"
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"Absolute shocking app. Bases profiles on looks. So if you get swiped left on lots your chance for matches lowers (which is absolutely disgusting). 
Tinder should create a friendlier algorithm for everyone."
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"Useless, used tinder for years, did nothing wrong would occasionally meet someone ok to go out with or even oddly enough make some friends off it, however one day went on and was hit with an account ban for absolutely no reason at all! You don‚Äôt get matches after a couple hours/days if you‚Äôre a male no matter how good or bad looking you are so don‚Äôt bother unless you want to part way with hundreds of $, had gold a couple times even then you‚Äôd get a few matches & then it would die again, not worth it at all."
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"I got banned a week after downloading it for the first time and I have no idea what I did wrong, I emailed them and received no detail whatsoever. Horrible."
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,Tinder developers are happy to take people‚Äôs money but have zero interest in addressing the prolific issue of rapists using the app to facilitate sexual assault. Tinder is complicit in this.
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,My account has being banned for no reason is there a way to fix it
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"Tinder hides your matches and your profile until you pay. I was using tinder for ages and nothing, but then when I decided to pay for extra super likes and boost etc, all of a sudden I was matching with heaps of girls. Plus, when I deleted heaps of stale matches, that also made tinder allow more matches that it hadnt. I think it monitors your profile. Absolutely bs control and waist of time."
tinder,au,11.26.1,4,Pretty alright overall
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"Not a safe app for women, and it‚Äôs designed specially for cat fishers and unsafe encounters to trap people without being traced after they do it. 
It‚Äôs a recipe for disaster.
There are much safer apps out there, that don‚Äôt cost through the roof."
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,Never match with people in my home. City
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,I got banned for reporting prostitutes on the app... it shows the intentions of this application .
tinder,au,11.26.1,2,Need to add filters so we can be more selective in what type of partner we are matching with. Please!!!!
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"I get it your trying to make some money, but it‚Äôs just not fun anymore. Tbh I‚Äôm never going to pay for tinder,  unless you drop the price to $5 a month then I‚Äôd consider it."
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"Member for 12 months. Got dozens of matches. Never met anyone. It‚Äôs not a site to meet anyone seriously. 

But worse after they had a technical hitch I couldn‚Äôt log back on to access my Tinder Plus. My preferences were lost. 
Support was poor. No help at all to fix. 

After I said I‚Äôd leave unless they helped me access my history they didn‚Äôt even respond. 

If you want to actually meet potential love interests there are much better sites. A waste of money and time. The hookups you read about in the media are hyped and are rare in my experience. Actual love outcomes even rarer. Save your money and go somewhere like Elite Singles where I personally know people who have had success."
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"Logged in to find I had received a ban, I can‚Äôt fathom what I could have been doing to breach their terms, I was having normal, tame conversations with all my matches and logged in to find I‚Äôve been banned with no recourse, opportunity for appeal or reason given.

Very poor form considering I‚Äôm a paid user and I will be seeking a full refund."
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"So my account was banned for no reason. I read though the guidelines just to make sure I didn‚Äôt violate any terms. I emailed support to see what the issue was and they told me that because my account was banned that I won‚Äôt be able to use it again. I figured it would be ok, I‚Äôd just start another account on a different number and unfortunately my phones ip is blocked so no matter what my number is, my email, location.... unless I get a new phone I‚Äôm banned for life for no reason. I‚Äôm terribly confused."
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,Someone I went on a date with was horrible racist and made fun of disabled people but I was nice all the way to the end he cracked it when I said I didn‚Äôt want a second date. And he has reported me for something and now I‚Äôm perm banned I tried emailing the support team on the 14th of October with no reply. So if you don‚Äôt like someone on tinder report them with false clams and they will get perm banned. Was a fan before this ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"For all the apparent bug fixes that app updates apparently bring, the app runs like garbage. Do you have the ability / knowledge to fix the broken notifications? Badge icons that show an unread message always persist even when there is nothing new? Is this big left in there to make people open the app more?

Include dark mode already. You‚Äôre gouging people for their money by making them PAY PER READ RECEIPT? even AFTER they‚Äôve paid like 50 bucks for one month of gold? What insane universe is this??

Just make a working app at least. It feels like garbage to use."
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"Haven‚Äôt used Tinder in a while. I open it and saw a message saying I‚Äôm banned with no explanation, and no reason at all I can think of. 

Be careful wasting your time with this app, seems you can lose your effort for no explanation or reason."
tinder,au,11.26.1,3,"I can't seem to see my matches when it says I have a new match and the messaging parts seem to not work. 

Also, it says i have 20+ new messages when i've opened them all! Super annoyed."
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"Honestly the app would get a 4.5 star review, but every time you open a message it says ‚Äúwould you like to video chat‚Äù

If that only happened on the first time you messaged someone that would be okay but not with every reply. It‚Äôs hella annoying. 

Fix it and I‚Äôll change my review."
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"it‚Äôs a good app with lots of beautiful girls, just disappointed i haven‚Äôt found love yet."
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"I have found this app to be unsafe and the company dose not protect its users from sexual predators, when you put a complaint in the is an automatic reply with no follow up, they are will to take my money but not protect me, with the unmatch feature the perpetrator basically becomes untraceable and our message history is deleted...
I will never again use this app or any associated with the Match company"
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,It seems like I‚Äôm dealing with either catfishes or bots on the app.
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"I installed the app and got the premium membership but after that it crashes and log me off, absolutely time and money wasting."
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"Was using it for 2 years in a similar way and one day I am banned. No reason at all.
Reading reviews and there are several others with same issue. Do developers have a reason???"
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,I used to love tinder used to recommend it I was blocked without being informed why and first time I‚Äôm aware of this happening and now I live rural aus and it was actually how I had contact with people now I‚Äôm stuck using bumble which i wouldn‚Äôt recommend either
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"Stay away from this app. It‚Äôs all about money with no ethics or responsibility 
Just like all bigtech. 
If a young woman is raped and is unmatched by the rapist, they delete all his messages. Tinder operates outside the reach of the law in your country. Do not trust them"
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"This app is no good, got a problem don‚Äôt worry no one is there to help you."
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"Was banned for no reason, I treated everyone I spoke to on the app respectfully, never had any issues or confrontations then one day I open the app and I am banned. Customer service did nothing to help me or even tell me why my account was banned."
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"I got banned from tinder yet I have no clue why or how, I want it back"
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"Had the app for a few months, paid for premium service as well as 5 boosts. Banned without reason or explanation just like many others, conveniently the day after I bought the boosts. 

Unlimited swipes is a premium feature yet they stopped showing my profile to other users anyway, probably to encourage you to spend more money. A life time ban to a paying customer without explanation is very disappointing to see.

Bans should be saved for fake and scam accounts, not people doing nothing wrong.
They‚Äôve lost the plot. Taking the app in the wrong direction."
tinder,au,11.26.1,1,"Tinder use to work perfectly fine two weeks ago but now it won‚Äôt stop glitching and force closing, nothing loads anymore so I‚Äôve been paying for something that doesn‚Äôt even work"
tinder,au,11.26.0,3,"Seems like I can‚Äôt send pics in pm
A bit of a bummer"
tinder,au,11.26.0,1,"All I wanted was to match up with a few girls to recreate the scene from the human centipede as a 4-way faeces eating orgy. No such luck, this app really let me down..."
tinder,au,11.26.0,1,"Lately it seems to be running really bad, it takes forever to view the next photo or if you try and tap on anything, the response time is pathetic."
tinder,au,11.26.0,1,"$43 for one month of gold?! $165 for 6 months and $220 for twelve?!?
Not long ago it was under $25 for a month!!"
tinder,au,11.26.0,1,A waste of time! matches do not communicate! inundated with fake accounts! Extremely poor Experience using this app service waste of money and time. Wish I could get a refund for the time and money lost on this Poor excuse for a dating/hookup app. Will never recommend to anyone.
tinder,au,11.26.0,1,"My account was dismissed for no reason whatsoever, nor was I given a reason as to why. Poor service towards a paying customer like myself.

Avoid this app at all cost!"
tinder,au,11.26.0,2,"No matches but that‚Äôs fine, however I‚Äôm only being allowed 20 swipes not a hundred
Scratch that. 15 swipes. Wtf is that?"
tinder,au,11.26.0,1,"What‚Äôs the point spending 43+ a month on tinder when the app won‚Äôt even load? Just force closes Everytime you click it. 

I have an iPhone 11 ( brand new) and I‚Äôve tried using mobile data & wifi. Wtf."
tinder,au,11.26.0,3,All this app does is want your money and to keep getting it. Unlimited likes? Well they still will only show you like 10 people near you for the day. I live in a huge city I highly doubt there are only 100 gays near me.
tinder,au,11.26.0,1,"I can‚Äôt sign up due to my number being banned, EVEN THOUGH IVE NEVER USED TINDER BEFORE. 
Their customer service is ridiculous and nonexistent, don‚Äôt bother."
tinder,au,11.26.0,1,"after being banned for tinder saying i‚Äôm under 18, i tried supplying my drivers license as proof of age. the customer service rep basically said it was too bad, that i would be banned indefinetly. i am legit 18, customer service is lazy and impersonal, rude and ignorant. i would understand if it were a mistake, but atleast own up to it and fix it"
tinder,au,11.26.0,5,Good one man
tinder,au,11.26.0,1,"Horrible app, customer service horrible, fake profiles. Had mine banned for no reason what so ever and unable to make new one but they have taken my photos. Would suggest bumble instead!!"
tinder,au,11.25.0,1,"So I‚Äôve noticed there seem to be a lot of abusive women on tinder now.
I didn‚Äôt join the app to get sworn at without reason
Please tinder can you recognise both women and men can behave badly, it‚Äôs not one gender."
tinder,au,11.25.0,1,"No reason given, went to log on and said I‚Äôd been banned for breaching their terms and conditions, I have never spoken or behaved in a manner towards anyone inappropriately. Extremely unjust to ban someone without giving them a reason, seems Tinder decides and gives no explanation of their actions...extremely confused by it all"
tinder,au,11.25.0,1,I subscribed to 6 months of subscription for 60 dollars but i keep getting out of likes everyday. Now i am confused what did i pay 60$ for(i did not swipe that much)? Now it keeps asking me to update to tinder plus. Why are u behaving like blood sucking leeches. If u take the money atleast make sure u give customer the satisfaction. But....greedy bunch...so disappointed
tinder,au,11.25.0,3,"All my messages are out the order they were received. I get notifications of messages, enter the app and there‚Äôs nothing there. I also get no notifications at some points."
tinder,au,11.25.0,1,It‚Äôs honestly been so glitchy lately...
tinder,au,11.25.0,1,"I am paying every month and i am trying to unsub the payment but it says you dnt have tinder purchased on apple store but the money is being deducted from my bank account , i am frustrated with this customer support"
tinder,au,11.25.0,1,I keep getting notifications yet it doesn‚Äôt update in the app itself.
tinder,au,11.25.0,1,"Account banned for violating terms within an hour of making the account, no matches nothing not even time to upload a photo or update my bio. When contacted they refuse to tell you what rules you broke or even investigate in the least. Worst business with an app in history"
tinder,au,11.25.0,2,I have paid for the app for 3 months and now it doesn‚Äôt open on my mobile. I tried to reinstall it but still not working.
tinder,au,11.25.0,1,If I could give zero stars I would. Not even a week into purchasing Tinder Plus I receive a ban with no explanation as to why. Seems I‚Äôm not the only one with a similar experience either. Useless money-hungry company; I‚Äôm going to Bumble.
tinder,au,11.25.0,1,Banned for no reason?? Can you please contact me so I can sort this out???? I‚Äôm so confused
tinder,au,11.25.0,1,I wish I could find someone but I can‚Äôt is app does nothing unless you‚Äôre female
tinder,au,11.25.0,1,"Having a paid profile and being able to hide the distance, makes easier for scams.
They should not be able to hide that."
tinder,au,11.25.0,1,By pesky bugs do you actually mean prostitution? This app is 90% hookers & people overseas. How bout a refund? Lolol.
tinder,au,11.25.0,1,"This is ridiculous, I am trying to create an account and used my phone number, received a verification number, enter that and then I‚Äôm banned? How the f**k does that work? I‚Äôve never had tinder before and just got the number and somehow I‚Äôm banned? So I emailed their support team and they say I have broken their terms and conditions but cannot specifically tell me what one and that I will not be allowed to create an account. And continue to send the same automated email. This is complete bull dust."
tinder,au,11.25.0,1,Tinder worked great at first but now I think there‚Äôs too many people on it and tinder doesn‚Äôt really know how to handle it. I have 100+ unread messages that aren‚Äôt even showing up in my inbox. Sometimes I get a ‚Äúnew message‚Äù and it was from someone I matched with ages ago - only now coming up. I get SOME notifications that I have a new message but the only way I can see it is if I delete and reinstall the app. Just not worth it anymore if they can‚Äôt handle these problems for their users.
tinder,au,11.25.0,1,"Tinder are the next MySpace. They were first in with the concept, aren‚Äôt offering anything new and valuable except to find new ways to be greedy and charge people more, have heaps of bugs, and full of advertisements. The user experience is getting progressively terrible, as they look to funnel you into Gold membership at every turn with hugely annoying messages such as ‚ÄòOH YOU MISSED A MATCH - GET GOLD‚Äô. Or pick 1/4 hidden cards to ‚ÄòGUESS WHO LIKES YOU - OHH YOU MISSED - GET GOLD.‚Äô There is better competition out now, and they haven‚Äôt realised that they are going down the toilet. Even if you pay you get ads. What a joke, you greedy narcs. Worst app ever. Hinge is 11110% better."
tinder,au,11.25.0,2,My account was banned cause I made a joke saying I was born in 2002 and it won‚Äôt let me update my license and I was talking to my future husband now I will never see him again
tinder,au,11.25.0,1,My account has been banned for no reason and when contacting tinder about it they don‚Äôt care and just send a generic message saying iv violated their terms when I hadn‚Äôt even used it in a couple of months before rejoining. The support team give no reason why even when asking multiple times nor do they care. Please get some actual people to review these cases for those who didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. There are a lot of reviews to back this up.
tinder,au,11.25.0,1,I was banned while I didn‚Äôt even have the app on my phone...
tinder,au,11.25.0,1,"Updated my iPhone and since, messages are no longer coming through. Uninstalled several times, logged out and logged back in more times than I can count, on wifi and off. Nothing."
tinder,au,11.25.0,2,Most of the match are fake iD
tinder,au,11.25.0,1,After downloading the app for the first time it wouldn‚Äôt  work and after contacting tinder I revived no reply I think it must be from poor programming and the assumption that one person app not working isn‚Äôt worth the trouble of replying very disappointed as I‚Äôd heard good thing
tinder,au,11.25.0,1,"Been using tinder on an off for a long time, account was banned today for no reason at all. After reading the reviews it looks like a common problem. I wouldn‚Äôt be so annoyed if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact I brought tinder gold a few days ago an had started talking to a really nice girl just as I got banned. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm finding her again. All I ask for is at least a reason for why I got banned!"
tinder,au,11.25.0,2,"The notification badges are annoying, they display their numbers for amount of messages+ amount of matches. You‚Äôd have to go through each single profile and looking at each profile for the notification to disappear. 

Consequently I‚Äôve turned off all notifications from tinder and now there is a pop up in every single chat asking me to turn the notification back on. How silly"
tinder,au,11.25.0,1,Updates do nothing other than reset the profiles you have already rejected. Tells you you have matches but if you become a member suddenly those matches disappear. Not worth the fee it charges. You don‚Äôt get value for money. Tells you you missed a match but it‚Äôs not a match if your not interested in that profile. Very few genuine profiles on here.
tinder,au,11.24.1,1,"I‚Äôve used tinder for quite a while and during that time it‚Äôs been great. I‚Äôve used the premium features where they have usually charged me around $22 a month if I wanted to upgrade to gold. But ever since I‚Äôve turned 28 I‚Äôm looking at the exact same upgrade options now and they are trying to charge me $44! üòì Now I‚Äôm not sure if this is an error, but charging double the original price is a bit of a greedy stretch, don‚Äôt ya think?"
tinder,au,11.24.1,1,When I use my phone number. It showed me have some bug can‚Äôt log in.  I already downloaded the new version of this app. Don‚Äôt know why ?
tinder,au,11.24.1,1,I‚Äôve contacted Tinder support multiple times to get my account back up and running. My phone was stolen from. Out of my control - period. They had my login details and everything. Please reactivate my account as the things they said under my name were not my doings.
tinder,au,11.24.1,1,"I‚Äôve used this app on and off for 5 years and actually really enjoyed it. 

Told a guy who had a problematic bio that h should get rid of it and he reported me for harassment and now I‚Äôve got a permanent ban. 

There‚Äôs no appeals process which I think is awful, because he was equally as rude back but because he reported me before I could unmatch him im the one that‚Äôs gone? 

What a joke"
tinder,au,11.24.1,1,"As it seems with far to many people, I was banned for literally no reason, reached out to the ‚Äòcustomer service‚Äô team (if you can even call it that) and got sent some blanket statement that they couldn‚Äôt do anything, literally what is the point in having an app if you‚Äôre going to marginalise and ban half the people on it for ‚Äòviolating terms and services‚Äô but then not actually check, I did not violate anything. Rubbish"
tinder,au,11.24.1,1,"I wasn‚Äôt talking to anyone, I wasn‚Äôt swiping on anyone, no explicit pictures, and no rude comments and they banned me. I wasn‚Äôt even showing my card."
tinder,au,11.24.1,4,"I just have a suggestion, I‚Äôm finding it hard to keep up with the boys I like better than others and who I would prefer to reply back to. If you could please make a feature for the next update so that I‚Äôm able to favorite people without them knowing that would be fab. Thanks"
tinder,au,11.24.1,1,Got perma banned because in my profile I said that I was only interested in matching with people who aren‚Äôt trying to plug their insta or OnlyFans.
tinder,au,11.24.1,1,"Why remind me EVERY MESSAGE THREAD about this face to face? I haven‚Äôt forgotten, I just choose not to use it.
Tell me once & that‚Äôs enough. Give me a way to ensure that it doesn‚Äôt tell me again."
tinder,au,11.24.1,1,Get banned for no reason and can‚Äôt appeal
tinder,au,11.24.1,1,Tinder you have become very selfish like every other dating app. Discriminating against men who have to pay for extras where as woman get endless matches. Banning users accounts for no good reason. Tinder should be taken down and shamed
tinder,au,11.24.1,2,What is with the face to face pop up. Why does it have to keep coming up? How do you turn it off it‚Äôs really frustrating
tinder,au,11.24.1,1,"Complete rip off and scam, did you know that tinder randomly shadowbans your account yet still charges for your subscription (which is $43AUD a month now, how ridiculous).
When shadowbanned: tinder won‚Äôt show your profile to anyone else but pretends like it is... how is that even legal"
tinder,au,11.24.1,3,All this app does is glitch. Why. None of the other day I apps glitch
tinder,au,11.24.1,1,"The app doesn‚Äôt always work, messages aren‚Äôt coming through when they are sent and I can swipe for a very long time without a match. The upgraded uses are super expensive. 
And then there‚Äôs the damn message that pops up every time you open a conversation ‚Äòdo you want to face time‚Äô where‚Äôs a button to tell that to never ask me again?! Because it‚Äôs damn annoying!"
tinder,au,11.24.1,5,Website glitches and crashes all the time mixes up each other‚Äôs messages annoying.
tinder,au,11.24.1,1,Stop repetitively asking me if I want to video chat with people in the same conversation over and over. It‚Äôs so frustrating
tinder,au,11.24.1,1,"I really enjoyed tinder then one day I got kicked off mid conversation with someone, I only had for 2 and half weeks. I ask for help and assistance in figuring out why I got banned yet they didn‚Äôt help at all. They didn‚Äôt answer any of my questions either. 
I know for a fact I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong because I was being cautious as it‚Äôs my first time on a dating app and I‚Äôm not dumb about these things. 
Fix your services."
tinder,au,11.24.1,1,"I only started using the app a couple of months ago. I haven‚Äôt logged in for a couple of weeks and have now been banned. I have an authentic profile and pictures, have engaged in polite conversations with matches and have not breached the terms of service in any way. No warning or explanation given as to why my account was banned and no acceptable response from customer service."
tinder,au,11.24.1,2,"I have had many problems over the years with Tinder where I have got logged out and when I have logged back in I lost all of the matches that I had. 
I also paid to be able to go backwards when I had swiped too quickly but this function is not working anymore ‚òπÔ∏è
When Tinder works it can be good as I have been on a few dates but I have found it to be unreliable"
tinder,au,11.24.1,1,"Check out the negative reviews! Majority of people are being banned for no reason at all. When you email tinder for assistance, you receive a generic email response and nothing more! They have absolutely zero costumer service. Disgusted with their poor service delivery and that they ban profiles for no reason.

I wish nothing but the absolute worst for this company, I honestly hope they go bankrupt or get sued.

Disgusting display of poor management!"
tinder,au,11.24.0,5,If I could give this app 0 stars I would literally banned for no reason as for being banned there was literally nothing that warranted the ban I had #BLM in my bio which is think is unjust and unfair as everyone should have a right to have opinion on things happening in the world as we speak I would not waste time or money on tinder as it is a rip off
tinder,au,11.24.0,2,the notifications tab wont close you click the x to close and the notifications tabs blocks the entire screen makes it hard to see the message your responding to
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,The app should have Face ID or Touch ID lock option so that no other person can access the profile and chats of the tinder user. It is sometimes very annoying when someone tries to read your chats even if he is your friend or family member.
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,"Can someone explain why I have been banned? No explanation, nothing. Now lost contact with someone I was talking to, thanks! Thanks so much for that."
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD I PAY $40 FOR TINDER GOLD
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,Messages and matches are not being displayed. If I open the web app on safari I get them but not in the iOS app
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,"Make an unread feature, so we can find all the unread messages caused by bugs!"
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,As soon as you pay for the membership they ban you. I repeat do not download this app or pay for tinder gold!!! Joke of a company.
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,"I downloaded the app and got my account going and after setting up pictures, bio and information (none of it was rude, racist or bad in anyway, shape or form) and my account was immediately banned! I‚Äôve contacted them multiple times and they won‚Äôt look into it at all! So to get them back I‚Äôll ruin the app by giving them heaps of terrible reviewes! Worst app ever!"
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,"I‚Äôve been trying to delete my account but it keeps coming up with the pop up, error. Try again later. It‚Äôs been later, I‚Äôve tried again. My matches have messaged me on other social media platforms asking me if I unmatched them as I have disappeared. I just want to delete and move on"
tinder,au,11.24.0,4,"If I was a vacuous 18 year old swipe night may have been interesting, but sweet baby Jesus it was painful if you‚Äôre over 35. Do people as empty as this really exist? 

Otherwise it‚Äôs an entertaining app. Will you find love? Probably not, but a chance to meet people you probably normally wouldn‚Äôt."
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,"Asking to video chat on every single message is the most annoying feature. Ask once and then dont ask again, please fix"
tinder,au,11.24.0,4,"I am a regular user of Tinder. What I hate is the fact that for the amount of money I‚Äôm paying for membership, customer support staff don‚Äôt hesitate to take your money and then not reply. 

I constantly get issues with this annoying ‚Äúwould you like to video chat with this person‚Äù. I keep pressing no and then it freezes my app. I constantly have to log in again each time it pops in, so I can barely use it. I constantly messaged the support staff 6 times the last two mo the and no reply. Don‚Äôt know if this is a joke, but for me to pay something that barely works is so unhelpful. I hope this goes to the app developer so the staff are trained into mitigating these errors."
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,"I set up my account, selected conservative photos, very transparent description. Swiped for about an hour in total, then banned. No apparent reason. Emailed several times to find out the reason, received very generic replies. Refused refund, refused to give a reason for the ban, refused to lift the ban. Unbelievably poor service. 
I have heard this happens a lot. Direct your search to another app, do not pay for this so called service!"
tinder,au,11.24.0,2,"Getting so frustrated with the ‚Äúenable notifications‚Äù banner while trying to write messages 
I don‚Äôt want notifications, you can‚Äôt make me.
Every time I‚Äôm trying messaging someone though, the pop up is in my way. 
Shouldn‚Äôt have to select no all the time."
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,"Since the last eat Swipe Night event launched I have not received any new matches even when boosting, and it‚Äôs telling me I have unread messages that I can not view. FIX THIS!"
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,"Tinder needs investigate all cases of why the ban Ur account, stop discrimination and stuff"
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,Had tinder for a couple of hours and been banned with no way of getting on unless I change number. There was no violations made as I barley had a photo jot conversation made
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,"Watched the trailer for swipe night and it seemed interesting. A few choices into the story though and I noticed the way to select your choice is bad/doesn‚Äôt work properly. It demonstrates a swipe, so I swipe the direction of my choices, but it chose the other ones! Didn‚Äôt even finish it, since the results would have been not what I wanted. There should have been a clear guide to the swipe night released before the event, and these problems wouldn‚Äôt happen. No way to restart the episode."
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,"I just got banned for being ‚Äúunderage‚Äù when i am not and have proven that to tinder before. I‚Äôve been using it since I turned 18 and now out of no where I‚Äôm banned until January 14th, which I have no relation with? Weird."
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,Too much fake account and not the real person in picture
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,All my phones were clean and after my Facebook was hacked they banned my account. And I‚Äôve been unable to get it back by contacting support. I‚Äôm disappointed and turned my friends off it.
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,90%+ fake profile not worth the time
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,"I have used this app on and off over the years and whilst it has never been the greatest, it seems to have a lot more people on it.
Just recently I was banned for no reason though and after trying to contact Tinder, I got a generic response and that they couldn‚Äôt help me.
I have done NOTHING wrong and I have NOT violated their user terms or anything like that, so I‚Äôm very confused why this happened.
I‚Äôve heard other people have had the same issue, so is this a common thing now, Tinder? Banning people for the fun of it? Surely you can give us a reason as to why you‚Äôve done this to our account? You want people to like you and your app, yet when it comes to something like this you literally just kick us out with no explanation... pathetic."
tinder,au,11.24.0,2,"You now get messages from advertisers directly in your inbox!

They also don‚Äôt warn you that using Swipe Night will cause the ap to:
- begin ignoring your distance preferences
- begin ignoring your age preferences
- make it harder to browse relevant matches by hiding their helpful info behind swipe night info
- change the UI (which looks worse, and bugs in some places)
- and you can‚Äôt reverse these

I contacted support and they offered irrelevant suggestions.

When I‚Äôm provided irrelevant messages, matches, information about those matches, and even support it makes me feel like my time is being wasted. 

I don‚Äôt care if there‚Äôs less content. I‚Äôd rather only read relevant content."
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,Got banned out of nowhere for no apparent reason!?! Can‚Äôt review it or anything along those lines...
tinder,au,11.24.0,4,"Swipe night is great!
Would be even better if you could see what your previous matches chose in swipe night episodes."
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,Money oriented app with no real matches initially got few matches that is not responding and then shows you have likes but never got matched with them. You have to pay for those matches.
tinder,au,11.24.0,2,I don't understand why I'm banned when the age is right ü§¨ I hope my account can be repaired
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,"Why do I have to pay more to see my matches.
I would like to unsubscribe please 
This site was to be free."
tinder,au,11.24.0,2,"I have been using tinder for a couple of years now. On and off. 
I normally have my card hidden during the day while I‚Äôm at work, and at night when I‚Äôm home I‚Äôll go on, make my card visible and have a few swipes here and there. My account apparently got banned. I don‚Äôt have any inappropriate photos or messages. I was barely even on the app. I emailed tinder and all I got back was saying that my account violates the terms and conditions of the app. I would like to know their reasons for blocking my account? Because there is thousands of other users who are in the same boat as me and don‚Äôt have a reason as to why? Or what they so called did."
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,"Banned for no reason at all, I'm a woman who has been using tinder for years and banned from nowhere and no reply from customer support. Absolutely disgusted"
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,Got banned for no reason :)
tinder,au,11.24.0,2,"It you‚Äôre looking at joining you‚Äôre too late! It used to be good, but of fun. Now it‚Äôs jam-packed full of fake profiles and prostitutes blatantly advertising. Tinder either has way controlling this or don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs so blatant I‚Äôm wondering if tinder are getter kick-backs from the other site‚Äôs using their platform to advertise? Shame, it used to be good, moving on."
tinder,au,11.24.0,1,lyrash now
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"This app‚Äôs greatest downfall is just how incredibly thirsty the owners are for money. They exploit being such a large dating platform to wring every cent possible out of you. There is no feature that hasn‚Äôt been monetised, as even the act of swiping is limited until you pay for more.

The features are all perfectly fair, and if even suggest that if they were included in some of the premium subscriptions, it may even offer fair value for money. But, the fact you can pay for a premium service, only to then still be asked to fork out for even more features is absurdly greedy.

The other major downfall of the app is the discovery algorithm. Rather than create a service that prioritises users getting good matches that they‚Äôre satisfied with, the developers realise they‚Äôll earn far more money by keeping you engaged with the app for longer and swiping more often. This is understandable from a business model, but it means a lot of potential matches never even get the chance to occur.

The final issue is with the UI, which has a habit of lagging or even crashing and is occasionally glitchy, which I‚Äôve seen result in lost message conversations. It‚Äôs also impossibly intrusive with notifications, promoting boosts times (another paid feature), and in-app banner notifications every time you open chat to enable video conferencing. Leaving users wishing they‚Äôd just go away and stop shameless grabbing for money!

The only redeeming features of the app are a simple system with a decent range of features (albeit hugely overpriced), and a large user base, giving it clear superiority of diversity compared to other dating apps."
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"Many years ago tinder wasn‚Äôt controlled by money hungry people.. you wouldn‚Äôt have to spend money to match with people, but now as soon as you create an account you will get matches for the first few days and then after that it‚Äôll be zero.. if you‚Äôre a girl, this concept doesn‚Äôt apply to you and you‚Äôll get infinite matches. They know guys will spend and waste their money so that‚Äôs why they target men. I find it disgusting that the only way to meet new people is to spend money. All the other dating/hook-up apps are like this"
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"Every time I log in it requires my verification via email, is that really necessary?"
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"I was met one person. When I met him, He touched my iPhone secretly and erased his number and tracked everything.
And he said ""contact to me again."" He so bad and disgusting. Why too many disgusting and strange people ? Almost they want to Onenight stand. 

At first, they acted as if they were going to be serious, but they were all disgusting people with masks on.
Seriously There are too many demons here, regardless of appearance or occupation.

I'm not the only one who's been through it. My friends also have many bad experiences. To prevent this from happening, please write down more detailed personal information for men so that they can join Tinder. There are so many people who do bad things. Cus they don't need write their detail information."
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,Worst technical support
tinder,au,11.23.0,4,Keeps glitching and shutting down
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"fix your bugs it‚Äôs soooo annoying. yesterday i opened the app and had around 510 matches and then today it went to 250 and started going up in intervals of 50 and now saying i have 450 matches instead of my normal amount. on top of that, notifications aren‚Äôt coming through even though i have them on. i‚Äôve tried deleting and reinstalling the app a million times and sometimes fixes it but most of the time it doesn‚Äôt

pesky bugs still get to be eliminated apparently"
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"No longer what it used to be. Now full of scams and people not interested in dating, just boosting their social media numbers!"
tinder,au,11.23.0,4,"I pay for tinder gold, it‚Äôs supposed to show you everyone who has liked you, but it doesn‚Äôt show you everyone as often I‚Äôll swipe right on someone who isn‚Äôt in my likes feed and it‚Äôs an instant match. 
It also repeatedly shows me people
 I‚Äôve already said no to"
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"A Hell of a lot of fake accounts since photos not been verified. 
Tinder free accounts are waste of time"
tinder,au,11.23.0,5,"awesome app! üëç met the bird of my life, super grateful üòçü•∞ü§ô 10/10"
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,Why is tinder so laggy. This is really annoying
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,Does not show notifications
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"The app always crash, and somehow I lost all my data."
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"App used to be good!! 
Now it‚Äôs just really slow& glitchy. With no support. 
Definitely gone down hill"
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,So this is the second time I‚Äôve made an account on tinder after my first one was suspended. I‚Äôve emailed them and still they‚Äôll say the same thing that they can‚Äôt relate the information. Pathetic. I had done nothing wrong and again I still get banned for it. Will never download this app again. Horrible support service too.
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,Fake likes and bad application
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,Selected the explore option and now I can‚Äôt change back to local search. If you want to keep the gay community remember you‚Äôre competing with Grindr. Grindr doesn‚Äôt have this issue and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be telling my friends
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,I cancelled my subscription and I‚Äôm still getting charged???? What‚Äôs going on with this app??
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"I don‚Äôt know why but they won‚Äôt help me,"
tinder,au,11.23.0,2,It was good until my account be for no reason and can‚Äôt even review it
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"Got banned. Didn‚Äôt say or do anything bad... There is no appeal process or even the courtesy of telling you WHY you were banned. If I have upset someone, wouldn‚Äôt you think you would let me know so I have the opportunity to correct my behaviour? Apparently not."
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,Another ban for supposedly violating community standards or terms and conditions. At least make the bans time out after some period or some other way for innocent victims to get back on (since your customer support just ignore people)
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,It‚Äôd be great if you could warn people prior to being banned for doing nothing wrong :) thankyou and while you‚Äôre at it have an appeals process???
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,didn‚Äôt do anything wrong and just banned me and can‚Äôt get back into my account and lost all my matches.
tinder,au,11.23.0,2,The new jacked up tinder gold price definitely made it not worth it now.
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,Unethical wankerism capitalism in its prime
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"nothing in violation of the Terms of Use, but got banned anyway."
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,Downloaded the app and I get banned the next morning with no reasoning on why I was banned. And now Tinder doesn‚Äôt have a process of unbanning my profile. So dumb
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"Not sure why, literally all my pictures where fully clothed, and my profile had nothing offensive in it that I was aware of. Guess tinder just plays revolver roulette with who they ban? I‚Äôve literally seen nearly fully naked men on the app so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,I was respectful to all women I talked to. had nothing political or offence on my bio and I still got banned. I‚Äôm a paying member I‚Äôll like a reason for my ban at least.
tinder,au,11.23.0,5,i met my boyfriend on tinder. he‚Äôs a loser but i love him
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,The latest update has an annoying ‚ÄòFace to Face‚Äô pop-up that appears almost every time you open a chat. The lag means it‚Äôll often pop up as you‚Äôre typing and it‚Äôs very annoying.
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,Bans people for no reason
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"After using this account for 5 years with same profile, premium account with 1 year subscriber, out of sudden I woke up with my account banned. I read the policies like 20 times and still don‚Äôt know what happened or why. I emailed multiple times to find out at least why, never a reply back. Only once a standard reply that I broken community standards. Which are? Not sure. 

I want my refund back for the remaining year! Or I will seek advices of legal actions. Seems this company don‚Äôt give a damn about loyal long term customers and ready to steal your money too..."
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,Great app but banned for absolutely no reason. Surprised they are making money still
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"Charges older people higher rates for premium. And I've read they charge different prices based on gender, sexual orientation, etc. 
What else do they discriminate about?"
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,Seem I have the latest version but the app just doesn‚Äôt work since about 2 weeks
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,Got a message from a about 4 girls I messaged 3-4 months ago saying they only received my messages now. Matches and messages and everything just take so long if they even work at all
tinder,au,11.23.0,2,This app is so slow and it ALWAYS crashes. Every time I open tinder it takes forever to load each page. God forbid if I ever swipe on anyone. I get about three people in and the app crashes. This app is terrible to use.
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"Bots, fake accounts and scams galore. If you like being banned for no reason this is the place for you."
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,App just bans you for no reason. Only had it for a week and didn‚Äôt breach any conditions or TOS.
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"Messages won‚Äôt load or show up, even after deleting , rebooting the phone and leaving the page open to let it hopefully load . Super annoying"
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"New update has broken the discovery feature so I can‚Äôt see anyone to match with anymore, what‚Äôs the point of the app now?"
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,Ridiculously expensive for membership and it straight up lies about how many matches you have in order to get you to buy Tinder gold. I get asked every SINGLE time I open a chat with someone if I want to Face to face call them and even if I open their profile and go back to the chat it will ask again. The only way to stop it asking is to say yes to it for each person. Absolutely ridiculous and a waste of time and money.
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"Tinder use to be good but now it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs been programmed by 4 year olds, I‚Äôve been banned about 7 times with no reason as to why or how I can stop myself from getting banned! You‚Äôll get matches on the first couple of days then it‚Äôll stop entirely unless you boost yourself, it‚Äôs really worthless and I don‚Äôt recommend trying it ever"
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,Issue resolved for now. App is still disappointing for the price paid for premium membership.
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,I went onto tinder this morning and it said my account had been banned and it‚Äôs unclear why? I also pay for the app so I‚Äôm not sure why they decide to take your money then remove the account WHILST still billing me!!!!
tinder,au,11.22.0,2,I like the app but it‚Äôs sooo slow it does my head in
tinder,au,11.22.0,5,"So I wanted to give Tinder a go, so I signed up but I accidentally put the wrong birth date and now I can‚Äôt use the app coz I‚Äôm ‚Äúunder age‚Äù apparently"
tinder,au,11.22.0,1,"Not only are the prices sexist based (costs less for females) by atleast 50% difference.
I was about to purchase gold untill you jacked the prices up by doubling it. 
What a rip off make it a fair price for everyone."
tinder,au,11.22.0,1,"My Tinder Gold account worked fine for nearly a year. Something happened in the last two weeks and the app is broken. All of the features stopped working and YES my subscription is still active!!!

I‚Äôve been emailing customer support for weeks with ZERO REPLIES or reparations. I‚Äôm now escalating my complaint to Apple."
tinder,au,11.22.0,1,I used to absolutely love tinder but now I‚Äôve begun exploring competitors apps as I just can‚Äôt handle how laggy tinder has become. I have an iPhone 11 Pro and have the tinder app up to date and whenever I open the app it takes well over a minute to load. It also randomly freezes whenever I‚Äôm in the app and crashes whenever I try to access the app through a notification. Absolutely pathetic
tinder,au,11.22.0,1,"Worst app. Never get any matches, have to pay for premium to have any slight chance. They‚Äôll send you notifications that a whole heap of people have liked you to try lure you in to paying for premium. This same situation  happened with all of my mates too."
tinder,au,11.22.0,1,"I‚Äôve had this app for more than a year and have paid for full. I have honestly only matched with one girl who I have met in person. Every other match is either a spam, or does not attempt to communicate. In my opinion, there should be a system put in place to eliminate those users, unless they actively communicate. I have so many matches sitting there and being stagnant.

But the main issue I have with this app, and I‚Äôm surprised no-one has mentioned this thus far; the 5 super like disappear if you stop mid-way and try to use them later. Sometimes I have found myself unable to find anyone else worthy of a super like, so I have left the app to come back to it later. Or sometimes, I haven‚Äôt had enough time to use all 5. I have come back, to find that I have none left and have to wait 24 hours for them to be replenished. At first, I thought I was completely delusional as I had maybe used them and forgot. Well, last night I tried again, as this time it was by accident. I used only 2/5 superlikes, as Tinder could not locate anyone near me. Well, I left the app and decided to go back on later (as sometimes that alone fixes the bug). Well I was baffled to find that I had no superlikes left? 

Honestly, the chances of finding someone is very very slim. They put as many obstructions in as possible to ensure you purchase every one of their products before meeting someone, even then I would say it‚Äôs not possible. I recently purchased the superboost (that is apparently there for limited time) which is meant to boost your profile up to 100x times. I had one person like my profile and as it turned out it was a scam. Like that product costs a fortune, you‚Äôd think they would make some effort into placing your profile on very top. But nope. It‚Äôs all false advertisement."
tinder,au,11.22.0,1,"Constant issues when using the app then was banned for no reason, given no explanation and am not allowed to appeal the ban. No team more useless than the Tinder team."
tinder,au,11.22.0,1,"I‚Äôve been using tinder on and off for a few years and have never had an issue with the app at all. I downloaded it last night, got three matches after about an hour, but then no profile showed up on the stack at all. I extended my discovery settings to everything and did all troubleshooting and still no profiles in discovery. I tried to delete my account and it said it couldn‚Äôt, then when I went back in to try again today my profile was banned for no reason. 
Whoever did your last bug ‚Äúfix‚Äù needs to have some lessons SMH.
Pointless even trying at this stage to fix it with so many other competitors."
tinder,au,11.22.0,1,"Permanently banned without explanation and no appeal process to be seen. Atrocious customer service. Plus the app is filthy, kind of glad I can no longer access."
tinder,au,11.22.0,1,"Paid for Tinder Plus. No one to swipe on. Extended search criteria - still no one to swipe on. Swiped from another country and same. Not one single card.  Tried to delete app so that I can reset it and it won‚Äôt allow me to delete. Quite useless.  Emailed tinder support 4 times.... no response in 7 days. It‚Äôs thievery.

Update:  I‚Äôm up to 6 attempts at getting help from your support team. Still NO HELP. I want a full refund.

2nd update. Still no response from tinder support. I made a complaint to the App Store who have refunded me. I suggest everyone who paid should do the same. App Store support team get ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
tinder,au,11.22.0,1,"This app has caused so much damage to society... where to begin?

The millions who have become addicted to an app that commodified human intimacy for its own profit?

The loss of self esteem, the mental health issues, and potential suicides from vulnerable  people using this app and feeling worst afterwoods?

Or just perhaps the incredible amount of wasted time society has put into this app?

I‚Äôm serious... and the research is a there should you care to find it.

Tinder is a cancer growing on a already socially distanced society and it needs to be taken behind the shed and put down immediately. 

An app will never replace the security of REAL human connection. You can have a hundred matches but it means NOTHING. Actually being vulnerable and learning what it takes to partake in a real life relationship has nothing to do with swiping on an app. 

I fear most of tinder may user base has absolutely no idea how to have a real relationship and most are addicted to getting attention and dopamine hits from meaningless matches. 

Wake up world, and delete this parasitic app."
tinder,au,11.22.0,3,I love the app but it‚Äôs hard for me to go onto it coz it‚Äôs so laggy and I can‚Äôt swipe most of the time or even text!
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,Why is tinder so laggy. This is really annoying
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,Does not show notifications
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"The app always crash, and somehow I lost all my data."
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"App used to be good!! 
Now it‚Äôs just really slow& glitchy. With no support. 
Definitely gone down hill"
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,So this is the second time I‚Äôve made an account on tinder after my first one was suspended. I‚Äôve emailed them and still they‚Äôll say the same thing that they can‚Äôt relate the information. Pathetic. I had done nothing wrong and again I still get banned for it. Will never download this app again. Horrible support service too.
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,Fake likes and bad application
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,Selected the explore option and now I can‚Äôt change back to local search. If you want to keep the gay community remember you‚Äôre competing with Grindr. Grindr doesn‚Äôt have this issue and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be telling my friends
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,I cancelled my subscription and I‚Äôm still getting charged???? What‚Äôs going on with this app??
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"I don‚Äôt know why but they won‚Äôt help me,"
tinder,au,11.23.0,2,It was good until my account be for no reason and can‚Äôt even review it
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,"Got banned. Didn‚Äôt say or do anything bad... There is no appeal process or even the courtesy of telling you WHY you were banned. If I have upset someone, wouldn‚Äôt you think you would let me know so I have the opportunity to correct my behaviour? Apparently not."
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,Another ban for supposedly violating community standards or terms and conditions. At least make the bans time out after some period or some other way for innocent victims to get back on (since your customer support just ignore people)
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,It‚Äôd be great if you could warn people prior to being banned for doing nothing wrong :) thankyou and while you‚Äôre at it have an appeals process???
tinder,au,11.23.0,1,didn‚Äôt do anything wrong and just banned me and can‚Äôt get back into my account and lost all my matches.

tinder,us,12.2.0,1,It won‚Äôt even let me log in now just wow
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"When you try to sign on, it takes you through a series of tests to make sure you‚Äôre real and not a bot but the tests are messed up. Example: it wants you to verify by showing you 6 pictures of an animal all flipped around and only one is right side up. You‚Äôre supposed to click on the one that is right side up. The first screen just shows you a ‚ÄúVERIFY‚Äù tab and nothing else on the white screen so you must click VERIFY. BAM... you missed one. Then it shows you the 6 same animal all flipped around with one right side up. You click on it and occasionally you get a second chance after you see the circled checked mark but most of the time it‚Äôs just a white screen as if your computer is frozen up but it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs Tinders program because you can back tab and then it will go back to verify your number or your email then do the exact same thing no matter how many different computers you try or your phone(since I tested it). I would not suggest this to anyone because then it locked me out saying I tried too many times and to try again later. Oh, I almost forget. I had already verified my phone number by using the code they texted me, my email by the code they texted me and and went through the picture verification where you click on all the pictures of something(a bus for me) the hit verify. I mean how many tests are required to verify that it‚Äôs not a bot to sign onto a dating app does a person have to go through then to only be locked out because the app has a glitch to a white screen or a needed up 4th verification process. Come on Tinder. Can you give us a break here? I don‚Äôt think bots are the problem on a daring app so much as the Algerians pretending to be someone they‚Äôre not and wanting us to send them money. Please fix your bugs and just let us sign on. Thanks!"
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,Too many conservatives
tinder,us,12.2.0,5,"Didn‚Äôt expect to fall in love, but ended up finding love unexpectedly. Haven‚Äôt been this happy in a while. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
tinder,us,12.2.0,5,"Good app , professionally made up"
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"It was alright for a while. Until I got banned for no apparent reason. Customer service was nice to some extent but cannot say anything else besides telling me they can‚Äôt tell me why they banned me. There is no appeals process either so once you‚Äôre banned, that‚Äôs it. You lose your account, all of your matches, and any subscriptions you might have bought. Play at your own risk."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,I don‚Äôt recall ever going against the policy of this app.
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,Shadow banned for no reason months after I deleted my account. Customer support is incredibly awful.
tinder,us,12.2.0,2,I‚Äôm honestly not satisfied. The app gets slower and slower with each update. It crashes doesn‚Äôt save swipes so you‚Äôre left looking at the same people when you swipe a few times over.
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,Help me
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"Crashes every 5 mins, new feature doesn‚Äôt even work, swiping on the same profiles that obviously don‚Äôt like u back. Waste of time as most dating apps are especially near me"
tinder,us,12.2.0,5,Amazing appp
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"It shows you everyone except for who has liked you, forcing you to spend money to talk to that person. Sickening."
tinder,us,12.2.0,2,Please please bring back group dating and also I‚Äôm tired of as soon as I get in this app it immediately ask me to super like the first girl that‚Äôs on the list like half the time they‚Äôre busted. Can you stop. This app is literally designed for girls to just get a lot of matches and followers and the guys have to pay for it to even get seen by any girls. It‚Äôs super annoying.
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,So here‚Äôs a bad review with no recourse.
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"Throughout the past 9 months I have probably spent around $600 at the very least on Tinder. Between the gold and platinum memberships and spending money on boosts just to get matches. You will rarely get matches unless you spend the money on boosts which is $4 for just 30 minutes. Then you‚Äôll get matched with unattractive people or people that have absolutely nothing in common with you. You‚Äôll also have multiple people who like you and then 30 seconds later their profile is no longer available. This happens at least three times a day. Most people on Tinder are sadly either unattractive, or have supermodel fake profile pictures or simply just want to waste your time and have you follow them on Instagram. Tinder is a joke. Don‚Äôt waste your time."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,My phone froze because of this
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"Don‚Äôt waste your time or your money on this app. All you‚Äôll see are people trying to get you to go to other apps like Snapchat to scam you out of your money. I can‚Äôt believe it actually works. But, I guess some people are so desperate for love they‚Äôll believe anything. Save yourself a lot of grief and try any of the other apps. I can‚Äôt believe Apple actually gave this and Editor‚Äôs Choice. Makes you question the legitimacy of that ranking. I‚Äôm sure Tinder just paid for it. You really should be able to give 0 stars. It‚Äôs what it deserves."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,You can pay for unlimited like ability but if you actually want to be seen they‚Äôll ask you to buy Platinum. They hold your matches hostage until you pay for gold or platinum. What a lame app. Save yourself the trouble of weeding out fake profiles. Again worst app ever.
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"I can‚Äôt stand this app. It‚Äôs buggy and you have to pay for platinum for it to even work. Even then, I hardly get matches that reply."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"Funny how men can talk to women like they‚Äôre crap on your app, but when an ex hacks your tinder and completely destroys your profile you ban them. Hypocrites"
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"Every single time one swipes right on someone that is supposed to be popular hit, the app asks if one wants to upgrade the like.

WE DO NOT WANT TO.

There should be an option to not see this message again."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"Get rid of this algorithm! When I set the age to 25-45, I want to see EVERY 25-45 year old in the radius selected. 

I DONT want to see 21 and 50 year olds that the algorithm chooses for me based on who other people with similar bounds have selected. 

Simplify the algorithm. And make your premium features cheaper. People want quality dates with people they like, and you make it harder to find."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,I paid for a platinum version and got banned for nothing. Don‚Äôt Download This App.
tinder,us,,1,"I would love a refund from Tinder. I used the app for free for a while and then decided to try to see what the Tinder Plus was like. As soon as they took my money, the app malfunctioned every time I launched it. No one would appear and nothing would happen. To use it, I would have to delete the app and redownload it and it would only work one time. SO NOT COOL. Tinder = theives."
tinder,us,12.2.0,3,"Plagued with fake profiles, bots, scammers, and people who don‚Äôt respond, but it definitely has its moments, there should definitely be an update where you can‚Äôt have an account unless you‚Äôre verified, all in all it doesn‚Äôt really seem to be worth paying for"
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,Hey tinder why am I regularly seeing guys on here under my age floor and well outside my distance radius? What‚Äôs that? It‚Äôs because your a parasitic company run by chuds who want to exploit the human need for connection and our imminent loneliness during quarantine to extract more data from us and increase your engagement metrics? I hope someone murders your families.
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,Tinder is filled with fake profiles that will match with you and then unmatch you. It‚Äôs tinders way of stringing you along to make money off of you. Tinder & These dating apps are playing on people‚Äôs emotions for profit. Read through the reviews of all the disappointed users there‚Äôs a significant pattern of the same reviews consistently which raises a red flag. To the developers you‚Äôd actually make more money by providing an honest service. I would spend more money knowing that I could match with real people but since I have studied the patterns of your system I know exactly what your doing and it‚Äôs highly dishonest. Tinder has fake profiles that will match with you and converse with you then they will randomly unmatch with you leaving you wondering what did I say or do wrong. It‚Äôs tinder‚Äôs strategy to keep you on the app. It‚Äôs like a video game you can‚Äôt beat you will keep playing until you beat it but if you beat the game you won‚Äôt play anymore. If you meet someone off of tinder easily then tinder just lost two customers.
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"So I made two accounts. Got banned twice. You go thru the app, you're gonna find several profile with half dressed people, right? I posted a picture in bra and panties, not posing sexual, just kinda vibing. I got banned for it. And incase you guys think I'm over exaggerating on how not sexual my post was, the same picture's been on my instagram for several months now.  The post was definitely a whoopsies but they don't allow you to just take the picture down and continue using the app. Because of that picture, I can no longer use tinder. I actually don't even know if it's that specific picture because it doesn't tell you what violated the terms. Doesn't say anything but account banned. There's no way to get back in once you're banned so don't spend money on it unless you plan on posting kid friendly pictures.

Tinder, FIX THIS PROBLEM"
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"I have been using tinder on and off since it‚Äôs creation in 2012. However, all of a sudden I was banned without any explanation what so ever. I have been around the country and never been once banned until I moved to a small college town where a group of people who do not like me decided to report my profile. This is absolutely ridiculous and wish that they would have a formal appeal process."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,So many soak and site crashes.
tinder,us,12.2.0,2,I have tinder platinum in the app barely lets me swipe anymore and it‚Äôs hard to tap on messages and sometimes the messages just glitches. Please fix this problem. iPhone 11 on iOS 14.4
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,Expressing any conservative values will get you banned.
tinder,us,12.2.0,4,The app works well and everything it‚Äôs just One glitch that annoys me which is the range setting for whatever reason no matter what I said the range yet let‚Äôs say 40 mile radius limit it will exceed it it and show me people almost 100 miles away still it should only show me people farther than 40 if I put it farther than 40 but other than that it works perfectly If that‚Äôs fixed it‚Äôs 5 stars
tinder,us,12.2.0,3,Stop it from changing my distance on its own that gets annoying pretty fast
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,Waste of time and money. I‚Äôll stick to other apps.
tinder,us,12.2.0,2,"The app is very slow,take hours to write a message and see a member profile"
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,too many liberals
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,I honestly don‚Äôt know an app as unresponsive and buggy as this app. App developers need to take a hard look at the UI and actually use it. Not good.
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"Wow. Just when you think the folks at Tinder had run out of dumb ideas, they prove you wrong.

Every new ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù is dumber than the last.

Also, a ‚Äúsuper like‚Äù should be renamed to ‚Äúsuper sure you WILL NOT LIKE THIS PERSON!‚Äù

And now they‚Äôre SO DESPERATE to have you pay money for their junky app that they‚Äôre ignoring your age and distance preferences in order to juice the results.

The dumb ideas just keep flowing at Tinder.

And then they want you to pay how much per
month?

LOLOLOLOLOLOL‚Ä¶ no. Never.

I really don‚Äôt think the folks at TInder understand that their app is a common joke. But hey‚Ä¶ folks at Tinder‚Ä¶ your app is a joke.

All the result of being run by The Match Group who only care about making as much as they can off of your loneliness."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,Can be good if you‚Äôre just trying to get laid but if your account gets too much attention they assume you‚Äôre a box. I don‚Äôt feel like doing 15 minutes of verification puzzles just to log in. What a joke
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"This app has gotten so bad over time. Super laggy just scrolling in your messages, typing on the keyboard is often delayed and janky with the keys pausing while you‚Äôre typing. Uses so much batter it‚Äôs insane. Maybe they are mining crypto I‚Äôm not sure but it‚Äôs widely awful."
tinder,us,12.2.0,3,"i hardly use tinder, when i do, i am not looking for hookups. some people are and that‚Äôs okay, just not what i‚Äôm looking for. i told some dude name Sean and he responded, ‚Äúnow that i know that i‚Äôll just have to convince you to sleep with me‚Äù. disgusting. no is no. convincing someone to have sex with you is rape. get rapists off this app. 
worst part, i reported it to tinder & who got kicked off the app? me."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,I literally was barely on it and im not sexual at all idk how i got banned
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,You literally can‚Äôt go on the app without it glitching
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,They deleted my account for ‚Äúviolating‚Äù some stupid policy and can‚Äôt even tell me what I said or did. Not to mention in MY area.. not a lot of the opposite sex on here anyway. They allow too many bots and chicks trying to sell Snapchat scripts... horrible app.
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,i‚Äôm banned :/ rip
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"I have been using tinder for about a week and a half. I even bought tinder gold, but i just got banned out of nowhere and i didn‚Äôt have anything that violated the community guidelines. i‚Äôd appreciate my money back or my account to be unbanned."
tinder,us,12.2.0,2,"I used to enjoy this app quite a bit. But nowadays, it‚Äôs too glitchy to enjoy. Every time I open the app, it freezes. And I‚Äôm paying for gold. I enjoy the features. But there a plenty of other dating apps that work just as well without crashing"
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"I don‚Äôt want my search filters ‚Äúexpanded‚Äù non-consensually to find even more ppl I‚Äôm not interested in. why can‚Äôt tinder take ‚Äúno‚Äù for an answer? if this app were a person it‚Äôd be a sex pest, jfc"
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"just a bunch of catfish, thots, toxicity on an app made by retards #sorrynotsorry"
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,Garbage update. If I wanted to see 18-20 year olds and people further than my distance range I‚Äôd set that option......don‚Äôt force them into my queue. I‚Äôd rather have no one in the queue than start seeing people 300 miles away that I absolutely would never meet.
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"Apparently if you have a date that wants to report you and delete your profile they‚Äôll do it no questions asked. There are better options out there. It was a decent app at one point but it‚Äôs gotten terrible. So many bots and zero customer service.

THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU, ONLY YOUR MONEY"
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,I think the company rips you off. I had my tinder for about a year and half so I decided to get the gold where you pay like $15.99 or whatever it was. The day after paying for it my account got banned and I tried to contact their support and they don‚Äôt have an actual support contact page. I barely used the app for talking I‚Äôd give my Snapchat out and I get banned. Hmm. Don‚Äôt recommend.
tinder,us,12.2.0,2,"I‚Äôve used tinder for several years but had it deleted for the past few months. After downloading it, I was quick to realize how buggy and pay to win it had become, with the ‚Äúpopular user‚Äù popup happening every few swipes along with the platinum enhance your like thing. Tinder used to be much more low key with just letting you swipe away, paying for gold if you wanted it.

Also, for some reason whenever I redownload the app the section where you can see your matches recent activities is there, but after a little bit it disappears which is quite annoying.

App used to be much better, went strongly downhill over the past year."
tinder,us,12.2.0,5,A great app to find someone to bury you in the woods!
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"ive gone months without matches despite Tinder telling me ""10 people like you"". it seems the only way to connect with those 10 people is to pay Tinder money"
tinder,us,12.2.0,3,"I set my age range to 21-40, but I regularly see many people aged 18-20 as well. Very frustrating that I see that, I have tried logging out/in and even deleting and reinstalling the app"
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,You post one wrong picture (my Instagram) and you get banned for life! I think that‚Äôs very unfair and changed my thoughts on this app
tinder,us,12.2.0,2,"I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs been going on with this app but all it does any more is lag, I‚Äôve given I trying to sort through my matches and message older ones because the app just freezes and crashes half of the time."
tinder,us,12.2.0,2,This app just keeps closing as your in it or it won‚Äôt even open. It takes a long while to open and just when u think it‚Äôs gonna open the app closes out. It take almost 5 try‚Äôs just to open the app. Also why are we not able to choose by ethnicity? We have to keep swiping left just to find a preference in ethnicity just to make a match.
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"I used to love Tinder... but recently I started using it again and it is completely unusable. Messages aren‚Äôt coming through though I see the notification, the app is cycling people I matched with in 2018/2019 and bringing them to the top with no contact, the swiping is slow and delayed. I have deleted and redownloaded and the only way to receive my messages is to log out and back In everytime I get a notification. I paid for a subscription this month but never again, I can‚Äôt even use the app."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,I want my money back my account was banned for no reason I had not broken any of the community guidelines after paying for tinder gold and not even being able to use it for half the time. There needs to be an appeal option because this is absolutely ridiculous. Also your customer support is awful. 10/10 don‚Äôt recommend.
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,I‚Äôve had this app for some time now and delete it a ton due to the fact of how many times it freezes when I try to basically do anything. It‚Äôs glitchy whenever I go down my own profile which should not be happening since this app has been around for a pretty long time now. Fix your glitchy app or else ima just delete it again.
tinder,us,12.2.0,3,It is a good app but it charged me 50 dollars for tinder premium and now I am heated... I don‚Äôt even think I can get my money back but as a word to advice: turn off your transactions before going into app!
tinder,us,12.2.0,2,Nobody wants to face to face talk or get notifs from one person in particular!! Get rid of that! It covers the whole screen and it‚Äôs super annoying to constantly close out of. The options aren‚Äôt bad to have but the pop up‚Äôs are awful
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"It‚Äôs not just me. Tinder has been banning more and more people for no reason. I am writing this because Tinder had decided to ban my account right before the weekend of Valentine‚Äôs day when i was making plans with one of my newer matches who i was talking to for a few days. Tinder doesnt tell you the reason of your ban; there is no way to appeal the ban even if you did nothing wrong. And truth be told, alot of petty people will report different accounts all the time just because they feel like it.
Tinder really needs to fix this issue or else this app is going to one day have no more users because no one wants to deal with this unfair system. 
Bumble hinge and other apps have never banned me by the way. Only tinder."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"BUGS they‚Äôre everywhere AHHhH HELP, ive never used an app this bad üëéüèª"
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"This app has turned me hollow. It‚Äôs only deepened the darkness which lingered from before. Any hope I once had about my own appearance in comparison to others has dwindled into nothing. Tinder has truly shown me how lonely I can be. I began my profile over two years ago, and not once have I ever been able to come close to enjoying any sort of relationship I‚Äôve been searching for. Every interaction with every individual on this app has fully been meaningless, and it has only reflected how I‚Äôll never meet anyone capable of reciprocating what I once felt. Tinder has truly robbed me of my fundamental understanding of attraction between people. Please save yourself the grief. It was too late for me."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,I‚Äôve had this app for 5 years and it‚Äôs at its worst. It glitches every 5 seconds and swipes people left for me when I can‚Äôt even rewind. Says there is nobody in my area when it‚Äôs at 100 miles when there clearly is. I also don‚Äôt like when I have my age from 22-32 and they give me 19 year olds. I have fully given up on this app and it‚Äôs sad cause I used to love it.
tinder,us,12.2.0,5,I met/had the best phone sex and only phone sex of my life. I saw Jesus. Thank you tinder. I hope to have more covid positive precious mobile phone sex next time. Real game changer with the vibrator I purchased... I unfortunately have been unsatisfied for to long and can‚Äôt wait to continue with the whoring. Tahhh xoxo
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"I‚Äôve been using tinder for a few years and let‚Äôs be honest with each other most profiles are fake, but occasionally you get to chatting to
Someone you click with and that was the case this week. Been chatting to someone and no sexual co text was mentioned by either of us and it‚Äôs been normal adult chats and this morning I greeted the individual and she replied and then tinder sent me a message saying ‚Äú they noticed messages that come across as harassment and I‚Äôve been warned, it could lead to a ban‚Äù 

Seriously? You high ? Your bots high ? 

You run this app like a communist country and it‚Äôs your rules and that‚Äôs it, 

Get a grip"
tinder,us,12.2.0,2,I have my age range 21-28 yet it‚Äôs showing me 18-20 and 29/30 year olds if I wanted my range to be 18-30 I would put it that way put it back to normal and not extending the age range üôÑ
tinder,us,12.2.0,2,"App was great until I got banned for no reason, not told why, and I just paid for Gold. People on here don‚Äôt have good conversations anyway and ghost for no reason. 1/10 would not recommend to friend."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,I‚Äôm a lesbian and this app regularly tries to match me with straight couples and men. LOL
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"I want to date people my age, which is why I put a range. I don‚Äôt want to date a 12 year-old. Stop trying to push pedophilia."
tinder,us,12.2.0,2,I have never used such an that devalues their customers. The biggest crap I received from the app was purely unacceptable and I‚Äôve denounced this app on serveral platforms. I‚Äôve gotta banned from the app and when I asked why they couldn‚Äôt tell me why and wouldn‚Äôt bother reviewing my profile. So if you want to devalues by all means go ahead. I won‚Äôt be treated horribly and ignored.
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,Not sure what happened to your code base but the app is just one big glitch and bug filled ux
tinder,us,12.2.0,2,This app is so glitchy it‚Äôs ridiculous. This is 2021 how long has this app been around?!? Patch it please it‚Äôs almost unbearable.
tinder,us,12.2.0,4,I meet a guy on tinder 2 years ago we went on 1 date and he has been my best friend since. Thank you Tinder
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"Match owns OkayCupid, Tinder, Hinge and POF. I was banned from all five and I‚Äôve done nothing to violate any community guidelines. You‚Äôre thinking, well come on man, you must have done something. My answer: nothing. Nothing that I can fathom and I‚Äôm a sane, sober, mature individual. Now you may be thinking, well what did they say ? My answer: they don‚Äôt. They literally will not tell you why. That‚Äôs crazy, you may be thinking. Yes, it is. One night in late December I noticed I couldn‚Äôt log on to all of them ( except Hinge, guess they were late to get the memo ) I figured there was a mistake, I got nervous, figured there was a data breach, and then I took comfort in believing they‚Äôd help me clear things up. Nope. They refused. That‚Äôs it. Charged, ostracized, sentenced, banned. No explanation. Match ? Wasn‚Äôt even active on Match for six months prior. POF ? Never on it, it‚Äôs ghetto. The others ? I hardly talk with anyone. Three dates past year, all went fine. Sexist, racist, abusive comments or statements in my profile or exchanges ? Nope. Nothing I can think of. Fascist company ? Yup. Legal ? Yup. Ethical ? Nope. The irony is, there are so many scammers and hookers and con artists on these apps, and they message me all the time ! Yet, I‚Äôm a 50 year old civilized gentleman looking for a meaningful connection on these swipe-cookie-cutter-superficial platforms, snd I ! Me ! I‚Äôm the one who gets kicked out of the club ! That‚Äôs nuts ! Treacherous and irresponsible and downright unkind and insane policies and principals on display here by these companies. Protecting others privacy by not telling me why ? What about mine ? What about my data ? My reputation on-line ? My cyber security ? I was a paying customer. That‚Äôs how you treat a king standing paying customer ? Nuts. I deserve an explanation. They don‚Äôt want to open themselves up to thousands and thousands of litigations. Soulless. Clubhouse and the new breed of matrices will send you packing."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,Its a joke of an app now.  Almost all accounts are fake and the ones that aren't fake. They aren't active at all and haven't been for years.
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,Basically from my experience. I paid for gold and plus. Over the 6 months. Why not try it out? But I was horribly wrong to find out most of the women on this app is promoting their social media. It is horrible being a man on this app.  Then the rest of the profiles are fake and loopholes leading to prostitution. Which is illegal I'm surprised this company hasn‚Äôt faced any major lawsuits due to this.... it‚Äôs illegal in most states.  But second of all. Women are very picky on this app and only swipe the top percentage of men 6ft 6 pack 6 figures that wouldn‚Äôt give the time of day for half these women. But again it‚Äôs a society problem this app contributes to this mindset and narrative some men get lucky but most of the men are left out to dry DONT GIVE THEM ANYMORE MONEY!
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,American trash
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"Not worth it. My likes have gotten zero response, the likes I get have all been hookers or scammers immediately asking for phone numbers. Most are IG/SC promotions to get followers. Complete waste of money and time."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,Tinder is a garbage app full of bots and they will charge your inactive account for things you did not purchase
tinder,us,12.2.0,2,The app is soo constantly slow is responding. I have resorted to using the web version most of the time. Would love to see some attention to correct this.
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"It‚Äôs been 3 years since I used tinder last and when I downloaded the app, I decided to just make a new account rather than try to remember my old login info/redo the account. 2 days later I‚Äôm banned because of it. Wouldn‚Äôt it make more sense to send an email saying ‚Äúhey we found an account that matches some of your info, please verify your info and remove one of your accounts?‚Äù This is so annoying and there‚Äôs no way to get any information or customer support from tinder. Nonsense."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"This is genuinely one of the worst preforming apps I‚Äôve ever seen on the App Store.  Constant freezing/ glitches/ crashing on iPhone 11. Shocking that a developer that is so well known released this to the public, luckily there‚Äôs plenty of alternatives that have development teams can handle building an app in 2021."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,Why don‚Äôt you let Iranian people use this app?
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"Paid for tinder gold, to only swipe on the same 20 girls every time I close and reopen the app. Not pleased, app needs to be fixed and I want a refund for tinder gold. Unhappy customer"
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,Feels like children took over the software updates.  Awful.
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"Profile was fine for a year ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è then all of a sudden I‚Äôm banned with no warning, explanation, email üòÇ TRASH"
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"I would love to use the app but a phone number is required no matter which method you use to login/sign up. I feel like that‚Äôs kinda annoying. If that could be changed, I‚Äôd love it."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"I‚Äôve updated already and it‚Äôs still lagging, that‚Äôs not fair at all for once I‚Äôve got all these messages and I can‚Äôt respond cause of the lagging, so messed up."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,My profile is pretty average and I don‚Äôt really have any issues with anyone on there. Got banned and I still can‚Äôt make an account. It‚Äôs sad to see this app turn into something that discriminates  against people using unknown metrics and factors. High potential squandered.
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"Start allowing ppl to put what they want in their bio. This app is a ‚Äúdating app‚Äù right? It‚Äôs turned into a hook up. Hooking up with random ppl is not safe. Yea it keeps you in business but once someone gets and STD, raped or killed they won‚Äôt be using ur app anymore is that really what it‚Äôs going to have to take. There should be a dating for relationship section or make it a actual hook up app. There‚Äôs no love to be found allowing creeps to be mixed in with the bad guys"
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,Not sure what had happened but the app freezes constantly. Terribly sloes when It is working. Been this way for several months. Ridiculous.
tinder,us,12.2.0,4,"I‚Äôve used this app for a little under a year and I‚Äôve had MANY ups and downs with the people on there, to the point where I would delete it multiple times because I got tired of it. But then I realized that I was the problem, with these kind of apps, you need to go in with the mindset of no expectations. I didn‚Äôt pay for any subscriptions either because I didn‚Äôt want that pressure. True that there are bots/weirdos and etc, but VS the majority, it doesn‚Äôt really make a difference. I became good friends with this super sweet guy, we had a platonic friendship for about half a year and now things have become romantic :) without this app, I would‚Äôve never met my best friend and my future boyfriend! The trials and tribulations were 100% worth it. Trust the process!!"
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,This app glitches way too much for being a popular app.
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,Number is banned for no reason I have never made an account before and the app doesn‚Äôt let you log in with an email
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,So I open my tinder account to see that it has been banned. I am very confused and upset because I follow all rules such as not harassing other members and being 18 years old as well as not sharing my phone number to be used by others. I tried contacting there support team for why I was banned but they said they couldn‚Äôt tell me anything. This is outrageous that I can‚Äôt get an explanation.
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,Keeps Freezing all day every day
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"No reason for the ban, account had been up for a few months and followed all rules and guidelines, support was beyond useless, fix the app or add appeals"
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"Tinder is not like it used to be back then. You have to pay to see who likes you, pay money to super like if you run out. Pay to swipe back. Pay to boost your profile. Tinder likes to show popular users the most and somehow think it‚Äôs helpful. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs controlled who you see and who you don‚Äôt get to see. I haven‚Äôt gotten any match in months after they started doing that. It‚Äôs just becoming like the rest of the old apps that are coming to an end. Tinder also promote who likes you and when you pay, it‚Äôs people you‚Äôve swiped left on before. Robbers"
tinder,us,12.2.0,3,"Who‚Äôs responsible for quality assurance testing? Please thoroughly test these new features before pushing them to production. i.e ‚ÄúQuick Chat‚Äù. The option is on the UI, but there is absolutely no functionality when selected. And what‚Äôs up with the app crashing all the time? I could be mid swipe and it just crashes."
tinder,us,12.2.0,3,"The first time I got banned was most likely bc if you‚Äôre a good looking girl on this app, a lot of guys think you are trying to promote something like OF or premium. (No shade, but I don‚Äôt agree with the concept at all.) so as I was being bombarded with messages assuming I was a BOT or someone who did that...I decided to put in my bio: ‚Äúdisclaimer: as sad as this is to have to put here, I DONT do OF or premium.‚Äù And almost immediately after I was banned. 

So made another account and had so many tech issues. I would keep popping up at the top of every matches list, when it was an old match and our conversation was deleted on their part but I could still see it. They would message me saying ‚Äúwe matched again‚Äù and I was genuinely confused. From your support staff you told me to delete and reinstall the app (not the account, just the app) and every single time I did that...the same thing would happen. So I believe matches thought it was weird and upset I didn‚Äôt reply and most likely reported me but I never got their messages which is why I had to reinstall the app. 

I think it‚Äôs important to look into peoples messages and the contact they have with people. If someone is kind and not in the least bit like some of the people that should be banned...just bc someone has/had thousands of matches and so many unread messages bc their notifications are off...doesn‚Äôt mean someone should be banned. Especially if the app was having technological issues where I wasn‚Äôt getting the messages in the first place. I email support staff several times and I like many got an automated reply...but one of their staff members was pretty great and not a bot type response and checked my account and realized everything was fine. Y‚Äôall changed the game as far as dating apps are concerned in my opinion, but please look into these bans bc so many of my friends have been banned and they like, myself are the nicest people and wouldn‚Äôt offend anyone and they are extremely attractive. 

Please consider an appeal process. Get back to that five stars y‚Äôall once were."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,Was blocked for no reason.
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,You can download the app but need to Pay in order to see who likes you .. it was not that way before.. I guess I will be deleting my app
tinder,us,12.2.0,5,App is pretty cool I just wish I could see my likes without having to pay or try to play guess who behind the blurry picture
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"There's plenty wrong with the app that makes it annoying to deal with and makes BUMBLE the clear winner.

Get rid of the ‚ÄúPopular User‚Äù feature and fix your distance tracking. If I have my settings to match with people within 15 miles of myself, I dont wanna be matching with people living 45 miles away..."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,You are a shell on a volume bring your price down for this service 56 dollars a month but people try it you‚Äôll make way more money by volume instead of 7-Eleven pricing. Trust me I know marketing
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"It‚Äôs hard enough to find a real girl, yet alone one on Tinder. 80% of profiles are just spam even if you get suckered into buying premium meme ships. And then in the other end It‚Äôs flooded with bots wanting you to add them on Instagram or OnlyFans so they can make money off you somehow. 

The worst part is that Tinder can easily fix the bot issue, but they refuse to, because they know a bunch of suckers fall for it, and that means more revenue for them. 

Uninstalled."
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,Tinder deleted 2 of my conversations that I was having. The swipes are extremely sensitive so you can easily ‚Äúsuper like‚Äù someone you aren‚Äôt even interested in. You can only ‚Äúundo‚Äù and action 1 time which is dumb. The overall app is terrible.
tinder,us,12.2.0,3,They usually put priority to the non poc. You can basically super like any qwhite person but they don‚Äôt put the same energy towards people of color it‚Äôs just like whatever with them
tinder,us,12.2.0,1,"They give woman too much power. I‚Äôm banned for life, this app is unforgiving and cruel. I‚Äôm switching to bumble. DONT DOWNLOAD."
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"This app has never worked correctly. It regularly freezes, doesn‚Äôt let me write or send messages, has an incorrect notification badge, and more."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I have and iPhone 8 glitches take 5 seconds after I press a button to respond I can‚Äôt even get on the app anymore bacause it‚Äôs the slowest app on my phone so I know it‚Äôs not my Phone fix It
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,I‚Äôm on iPhone 12 Pro Max with the most up to date iOS. I subscribed to the gold plan for a month and this is my first time ever using this app. For the most part it has been a pleasant experience as far as user to user engagements. Now I recently updated my profile and have seen 500 likes a day to 1000+ just overnight alone. Since waking up whenever I open the app it just glitches and freezes. I‚Äôve deleted and reinstalled the app many times now. I cannot click message without the app freezing. It‚Äôs up to date as well. Not sure what to do but I am sure that I‚Äôd like my a prorated amount of my money back since I cannot use the app for whatever reason you all come up with.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Almost impossible to delete, 3 weeks and not 1 reply. It‚Äôs a scam unless you want to pay for their highest costing 3 layer billing."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Hilarious. The moment I don't have platinum or plus it shows I have likes from other users. I'm seeing a pattern here‚Ä¶ and message notifications are still broken despite deleting and re-downloading, restarting and logging out. App crashes when it feels like it. I even saw a profile indicating they had liked mine without the option to super like them. And of course they were nowhere to be seen in my like section while subscribe to platinum. This app is basically in beta perpetually."
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,I hate this app because it freezes up and glitches a lot
tinder,us,12.1.0,5,Thanks tinder you guys are a blessing you saved me I finally made real friends I can open up too thanks tinder y‚Äôall the best
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,Thanks for the dating app.  But unfortunately I installed this app for about 3 months and I have not had any conversations so far!  I think liking others on a daily basis is tedious and repetitive!
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Seems to happen often to people. Had deleted my profile so I could have a fresh start after dating someone for a bit. Redownloaded the app and began to make my profile. Literally had the app for 5 minutes and was banned. Profile wasn‚Äôt even complete and my pictures were not inappropriate. Tried to submit a ticket but the customer support was terrible.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,$15.00 per moth and if I want to meet someone you have to come up with more money. This is my last month of this ripoff.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Pls fix in new update
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Was banned for no reason. Wouldn‚Äôt even let me appeal
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"the app crashes all the time, freezes, takes forever to load pictures, won‚Äôt let me press the escape button from people‚Äôs profiles, etc."
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,Tinder works amazing for me and always has. In the last month or so my tinder had been EXTREMELY laggy and i‚Äôve hoped that their was an update soon to fix it but it hasn‚Äôt come yet. I‚Äôve deleted my app multiple times to see if it fixes it and it doesn‚Äôt. Needs an bug update super bad.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"There‚Äôs just too many fake profiles for us, about 95% of matches immediately ask me to add their snapchat for only fans or to ‚Äúhookup‚Äù. And the 1 or 2 that seem to be real just aren‚Äôt even close to what I‚Äôm looking for in terms of location or even interests."
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,When you go to chat with someone I have to constantly close out the app and reopen it in order to type anything it rarely lets me use voice text which is my main way of communication and all of the guys on here lie about wanting to be in a serious relationship.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Can‚Äôt even use the app anymore because it‚Äôs so slow. It will barely even load when I first open it. If it does, it‚Äôs SUPER laggy and I can‚Äôt even send a message or likes because the app crashes or won‚Äôt respond to my touches on the screen. Absolutely ridiculous how long this has gone on for. Deleting my profile AND canceling my subscription. DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR PURCHASE ANYTHING ITS NOT WORTH IT."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Can ya‚Äôll stop banning people? Like seriously for NO reason ... take a page outta Bumble‚Äôs book
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I can‚Äôt handle paying for ‚Äúplatinum‚Äù or ‚Äúgold‚Äù and still having to deal with pop ups every 5th swipe asking if I want to super like. 
If you ignore it, who cares they will interrupt the ‚Äúlike‚Äù and bring you to a separate screen asking AGAIN if you want to use a super like. 
Subscription canceled. 
App Deleted. 
You probably should rethink this ‚Äúfeature‚Äù as it makes using the app tedious and clunky."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Stop making me match with people I clearly swiped no to. It‚Äôs messed up.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Try something legit and not this. Its design to get you to pay for the subscription. It definitely got me... most of the profiles never reply and the consensus from the women on the platform all suggest the platform is maybe 75/25 males. Platinum gave me more bot matches but again no one replies. Disappointing tbh.
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"How long does it take to fix a keyboard? Do the tinder devs even test their own app? The keyboard is broke af! 
I‚Äôve met a few good dates through tinder though. So 2 stars, would be 4."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,a hookup app
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Yeah this app is trash don‚Äôt waste your time no one ever reply‚Äôs I get mostly bots and fake accounts that ask me to sign up on some weird porn site
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Tinder the biggest dating app should not be this buggy.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I did nothing wrong on the app and yet now my account is banned and anyone who tries to sign in on my phone now gets their account banned too. I cannot reach anyone to get this rectified. Terrible customer service.
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"I created an account on Tinder, I created an account 12am on my 18th birthday. I logged in and It wasn‚Äôt 2 minutes in until it said I was too young. I was very confused, I was 18 but it said I was blocked from using the app. :/"
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,"I hate that every other time I swipe left on my Likes page, it takes me to the Fast Chat/Hot Takes page. It‚Äôs very frustrating and would prefer to click on the icon on the top to take me to the Fast Chat page should I chose to use it."
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,I woke up and was ready to swipe/continue talking to matches and I was informed I was banned. I am confused and aggravated as to why I was banned and they didn‚Äôt even tell you. All they say is you broke the guidelines. There are plenty of guidelines so how can I plead my case if I don‚Äôt know what I did wrong. It‚Äôs hard enough to meet people because of covid now this? Not cool tinder.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,So many bugs.  Pages never load.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Tinder bans random accounts for no reason and won‚Äôt allow the person to get there account back or make a new one. I came back to my tinder and it was banned for no reason I had no nudity or any content that was against there guidelines.
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,"Best I can give this app right now. It may just be me but, I have to constantly delete the app and reinstall, the app lags terribly. I get notifications for messages but nothing new comes up when looked at untill reinstalled. This problem only recently appeared, the constant reinstall is new but the lag has always been there"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I am an ugly individual and you will not get any walls if you use this app if you‚Äôre ugly soooo yeah you‚Äôre better off like doing something else with your time then she can people you‚Äôll never get with that‚Äôs it...
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"I recently bought a new iPhone. Backed it up from my old iPhone. When I went to go sign in it had deleted my profile somehow and made me create a new one. My number wouldn‚Äôt work, my email wouldn‚Äôt work. It literally made me create a new profile. Which is very upsetting considering I just got good in my old profile and now that‚Äôs all gone."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I was suddenly banned for absolutely no reason, with no warning whatsoever. This app is crawling with catfish and bots; seems to me like THOSE accounts should be getting banned. It makes no sense!"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I was banned for no reason, completely out of the blue. I‚Äôve never had any issues so this was just surprising. No conversations that would remotely suggest that I need to be banned,  no prior warnings, nothing. Literally just the most random form of banning an individual."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I receive a text message one day from Tinder almost as if someone might‚Äôve been trying to log into my account. Next time I go on it says I‚Äôve been banned, no description as to why just I need to read the Terms and Conditions. 

I tried looking for a customer service email, nothing. Then they have this number for people to call and all i get back is static. Not too sure I do now except find another app I guess."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Was banned from using Tinder and tried to contact customer support and they gave me some pre-written response. Nobody can answer why I was banned, which I think is a fair question to ask since you‚Äôre banning me for god knows what. I think it‚Äôs unfair because you got fake profiles on your app and people soliciting, but that‚Äôs okay apparently"
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"Switching screens from messages to swiping is super laggy. 

Messages take forever to load. I‚Äôve had messages send on the ‚Äúwrong side‚Äù where it looks like my match sent my message. 

Please rewrite your database code ASAP cuz this is just not a good experience. Eventually I just say ‚Äúwanna switch platforms for messaging?‚Äù with peeps I match with cuz it‚Äôs so buggy."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"The advertising popups that Tinder have started to automatically open other apps on my iphone. This should be illegal and is how spyware and adware are installed on the phone. 
Beware of downloading Tinder till they fix this."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Tinder keeps on doing this thing whereby it removes my conversation from the other persons phone such that even when they try to message me, they can‚Äôt find me anymore unless I message them before we would be able to continue chatting.

Before I noticed this, I always used to think that the person has probably unmatched with me not knowing that the fault is all from tinder and the person is just there hoping to get a text from me"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Got banned for no reason after having tinder for years whenever it even came out. Never said Or did anything inappropriate. Half of them hooked up with me and had sex .Well even before these stupid bans i would keep  getting a notification of a new message and match and when I go on nothing shows up and I have to delete the app or log out and log back in and then the message will appear. But after doing this for so long it‚Äôs very frustrating and annoying. This app is now trash..
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Used passport to travel to very diverse areas, i.e, Atlanta and Houston and it takes forever to even see one person of color. Top picks change daily, not one person of color for an entire month."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"You can only see who likes you if you pay.
There‚Äôs plenty of other apps out there where basic functionality is free.
Also no physical descriptions on profile data.
Height & Weight? Hello?  Again - Where is the basic functionality???"
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,Spotify populates profile with a bunch of nonsense and you cant remove neither by disconnecting Sp nor by removing each song individually
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,Cant use the new feature lol it's not worth it tbh tho maybe I'm destine to never find someone but I've been on it for 6-7 months and I haven't found anyone. I get matches but not ever has it lead to anyhting
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Waste of time
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Lol ok
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I was just on tinder about 30 mins ago and hop off it and went back on YouTube for an hour then came back to tinder to find out my account was ban. Not even sure why? You guys are banning the real accounts and keeping the fake accounts on here.  Give me my account back or at least let me make a new account.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Like the title says... fake accounts
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Its highly controlled. All they give me are big fat whales of people because they have something against me.
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,Why implement a fast chat option when all that happens are pairing errors. Useless function.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Mostly fake profiles, people who live nowhere near you, and the occasional gold digger. Complete waste of time."
tinder,us,12.1.0,5,Y‚Äôall bless me with endless thick girls üôåüèæ
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"I purchased Tinder Gold some time ago. For the last month or so, it‚Äôs has been incredibly slow and laggy. I have to push a message 10x before it opens. Takes a long time to type a messages. I can hardly even scroll down the message page or thru my matches. I‚Äôve tried deleting and reinstalling and no difference. Plzz help."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,It won‚Äôt let me delete my profile!! Nothing loads at all.
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"As with every other dating app, the creators are just trying to make money. That being said at least they give the basic messaging for free, but it definitely could be better."
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,"The best game on my phone by far. Hours of  endless human entertainment. Can definitely get weird sometimes, but overall a great and low quality waste of time. If u didn‚Äôt hate men already this is sure to do it !"
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"The app is great for connecting with new people but I get SO sick and tired of the app constantly recommending that I super-like someone after just liking them. If I wanted to super-like them, I would have. STOP RECOMMENDING THAT I SUPER-LIKE EVERY OTHER PERSON!!! I really wish I could turn this feature off all together. Just let me do what I want"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I currently can‚Äôt even access my messages without deleting and redownloading the app. It‚Äôs not worth the time it takes to read one message, reply, and do it all over again. The app is extremely buggy in other ways as well, this is my most recent one however."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Was banned for no reason and tinder refuses to give me an explanation.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"The app is kinda bad these days. 
Lots of low quality women. 
Pay wall to see who has liked you. 
Many over the hill women with kids looking for a simp... 
About a million bots, all with the same spam bio...

Oh, not to mention they‚Äôll shadowban you for any little reason."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Be aware if you express any opinion or notion that may infuriate a wokester aka ‚Äúmodern bigot‚Äù they will get you deleted very fast.. even if you express sympathy to somebodies misfortune and get labeled as an ableist. Strange world we‚Äôre in. Save your money
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,Quick chat does not work. It either bugged or not complete
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Unfortunately this app is going to crap, you randomly get banned for no reason whatsoever. I made an account and after two days noticed I wasn‚Äôt getting any matches, I logged out of the app thinking it was a glitch and when I went to log back in it said I was banned."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I was on the app for maybe a couple days and was randomly banned for no reason and there was no appeals process
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,I have an IPhone 11 Pro and this is probably the laggiest app I‚Äôve ever used üò¨
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,They banned me for no reason. Like I had this really hot girl I was talking to and I liked her but when I went back to get her number I had been banned for something I didn‚Äôt do. I don‚Äôt post nudes or anything or y‚Äôall to people crazy. I just swip and chat. And y‚Äôall banned me..??!! UN BAN ME
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Tinder is very anti-consumer and rigged. They shadowban in a heartbeat and all this time I thought it was my profile. I get matches which disappear if I even get matches at all now. And my messages never send. Tinder is shadowbanning and worse is if you paid for platinum it like I did it still changed nothing. You would think they would at least drop it for a paying customer but no they don‚Äôt. Do not use this greedy garbage app, you‚Äôre better off approaching people in person or sliding into Instagram dms."
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"I‚Äôm so sick of the glitches. I had the entry version then upgraded to the next. It seems that in any version, the glitches are and have been the same. Messages are sent and received months even up to a year later. I think they‚Äôre playing with our money that if they hold our incoming likes, we will feel compelled to pay more money to upgrade. I don‚Äôt know. It doesn‚Äôt explain why the app often gets stuck showing only half of the screen and sometimes sends messages twice. It‚Äôs not like it happened and then got fixed. It always happens. I like that it‚Äôs the least complicated dating app but the frequent glitches make a pleasantly simple app complicated and annoying."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Tinder seems like a good concept, but after using the app I‚Äôve noticed a lot of fake profiles and or a lot of age discrepancies. I even hung out with a guy who stated he was 22 on the app then come to find out he was actually 19. While tinder seems to go to great lengths to get accurate information and a lot of verifying it‚Äôs also kind of annoying I have to give out all that information not knowing if tinder will sell it... I also think there‚Äôs an issue with banning. The lacking of an appeals process and relying on user complaints or the algorithm to ban people is pure laziness on the tinder team. People get wrongfully banned or banned without knowing why and it‚Äôs ridiculous. There‚Äôs a lacking of customer service and usually when you want to complain or contact the company you are just redirected over and over again to already posted information On the site. Then when you do finally submit an issue they‚Äôll send you an email with regurgitated information. Truly this app is a for profit business now constantly pushing for you to upgrade to tinder gold or buy super likes and doesn‚Äôt seem to care about anything other than that."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I got this app as a joke but I was quite surprised to see them ban my account for having pineapple/he/dog in my bio. The hypocrisy is unreal because people put she/they or unidentified but I can‚Äôt identify as a dog? This corporation is luck I don‚Äôt care enough to make a big deal out of this, I honestly find it funny this is what our media is like."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I've had the app for quite some time now and while the app is fine, the customer service is atrocious! I've been getting charged for tinder gold with no way to cancel the subscription for a very long time. I've tried deleting my account, and every possible way that their ""support"" team has on FAQ. I have an iPhone I know how to cancel subscriptions on their but what happens when you order the subscription on an Apple account that has been hacked I have no way of getting to my old account my phone was stolen and email associated with the account was hacked changed the password and haven't been able to get in since, this has been 2 years now. Crazy to think of a company this big not having an email or phone number or anything for you to be able to call or message in case of situations like this but I guess in their eyes it's a good business scheme scamming people out of money bc they have no way of canceling their subscription. Imagine Netflix or Amazon not having any customer service and you have no way to cancel their subscription, even if you delete your netflix account you still get charged that's absurd. I need help and I've needed it for a long time now but I'm just here to raise awareness and hopefully save someone else from being charged over 150 dollars a year for something they don't touch and have no way of canceling. HELP AS OF NOW IM STILL BEING CHARGED"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Tinder has fallen off in the worst way possible. The app doesn‚Äôt even function as it‚Äôs supposed to and more than half the time will straight up crash your phone. Likes don‚Äôt get sent. Every time you reopen the app, you‚Äôll see the exact same people you swiped through before. It‚Äôll ask you if you want to send a superlike to the first person you swipe on, and then will take it away for 24 hours as if you superliked somebody even when you didn‚Äôt. And if you should even try to delete your account, you‚Äôll get an error message that says something went wrong and they can‚Äôt process your request. Like the title says, don‚Äôt bother wasting your time, use any other dating app if you actually want to meet somebody."
tinder,us,12.1.0,5,Muy bueno
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"For the past couple days, I‚Äôll get notifications; new matches or messages, and when I open the app, there‚Äôs no new notifications there. I‚Äôve had my account off and on for a couple years now. I‚Äôve never experienced this. The app is up to date. I hate to leave. But after this I am."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,:(
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,I do not know what happened in the last year but this app has become so laggy and glitchy that it is almost unusable
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Not only is it full of bots & sex workers soliciting who try to solicit customers for their Snapchat‚Äôs and beg for money on cash app but on top of that they will ban legitimate accounts randomly for no reason.
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,Omg tinder is soooo glitchy. Good app though to find people to hangout with.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"There are a lot more fake profiles than real ones.  The verification process doesn‚Äôt work. The first month, I upgraded to ‚ÄúGold Member‚Äù only to be bombarded with fake profiles. The 9.99 memberships doesn‚Äôt let you do anything, not even see who ‚Äúliked you‚Äù.  You‚Äôll need to have, at least, the Cheapest ‚Äúgold status‚Äù to anything."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Unfortunately this is one of the very few commonly-used apps by people my age for meeting new friends or dating. I hate how much trying to meet people is treated like a ‚Äúgame‚Äù. I understand that‚Äôs part of the appeal, but we‚Äôre also dealing with real people, real lives and real mental health concerns related to this app. Paying $16 a month for a service, you should be able to reasonably expect better functionality.

My main complaints are really these two things:

1.) the app is EXTREMELY bloated/slow/unresponsive. The layout is fine, but everything is extremely laggy and feels unrefined. Especially in the current version at the time of this review.

2.) why is it that someone can unmatch with you and completely disappear from your chats with no way to report them? Is it for their safety? What about mine? What about when someone gets catfished or gets assaulted or another bad experience happens with a user, but they have no way to warn other users? This is a huge concern to me, and I have personally had experiences that made me doubt that Tinder actually cares about the safety of their users ‚Äî despite the marketing gimmicks built-in to the app.

Please fix this laggy mess that is the current version and rethink your unmatch workflow."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"So i re-prurchased gold and my app now lags, and all my matches do a weird thing where they disappear and reappear within seconds (NOT BEING UNMATCHED). I went to contact support for help, but they want to claim nothing is wrong and that people are simply unmatching with me. 

Any new message, match, notification, i cannot look at without uninstalling then reinstalling, not very happy with whats going on, especially if im paying for a premium subscription when before everything was fine."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I started using tinder and I got on the app one day and was just banned. I didn‚Äôt get any email asking questions. I can‚Äôt make another account. I see that a lot of people have been banned for no reason at all. I feel I have been wrongfully banned and if this whole thing could be fixed it would be appreciated. Tinder needs to start a repeal process.
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"Once pictures are uploaded to your profile, they become really blurry. Like, really blurry. If there was some way the quality wasn‚Äôt ruined, the app overall would feel more authentic and genuine."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Tinder purposely doesn‚Äôt allow you to match with people why does it say 99+ matches and then I‚Äôm lucky to get one person to match with me.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I deleted tinder and my account after I met my ex but now it‚Äôs telling I‚Äôm banned no matter what phone number or email I use on my phone it tells me I‚Äôm banned. This whole app is horrible and I see I‚Äôm not the only one who has this problem.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Banned for no reason.
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,Hey can you fix the bugs. I‚Äôm trying to sign up but it won‚Äôt let me put in my birth year
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,the app is completely filled with bugs and the chats lag along with the swiping function. kindave surprising such a popular app works so poorly
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"They banned me from their platform for no given reason. Had no offensive encounters with anybody, followed all the rules of the account and agreements yet I was banned mid conversation with a match. It intentionally gives you people from distances over 50 miles away even though my maximum limit was set to 35. Only shows you one, maybe two people who like you a day. The entire app is a ponzy scheme to get to to pay for gold then ban you directly afterwards."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,She was a Man
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Although I had at least one great outcome on Tinder (a LTR with someone amazing), I learned the site‚Äôs management is rather heartless as well as arbitrary and capricious in meting-out a ‚Äúbanning.‚Äù In my case, even the most cursory, superficial review of my interaction with one person (turned out to be a fake/fraudster) would establish that there had been no violation whatsoever of the site‚Äôs Terms of Use. Rather, even a cursory review would have revealed that a match quickly asked me to connect ‚Äúoff-site,‚Äù something that‚Äôs sometimes a badge of a fake/ fraud, but sometimes not. I‚Äôd never had any repercussions before from testing those waters; I was always able to identify the scam early‚Äîjust as I did on this occasion. So after having an initial connection off-site and in a few texts of 5 minutes or so, I declined the demand for a code (actually gave a fake one, and backed out of the texting-exchange), and ‚Äúblocked‚Äù any contact going forward. Again, all this was off-site.  
Content that the fake/ fraud was avoided and dealt-with successfully, I tried to renter the Tinder site, my mind set on reporting this profile as a fake / fraud. But apparently, and sadly, the faker/fraudster evidently beat me to-the-punch and submitted a fake-retaliatory complaint that inexplicably resulted in me being banned!! No amount of communications could elicit even the courtesy of a response. And the fake/fraudster presumably went on to scam another day with impunity, me a casualty. 
But I was also victimized by Tinder‚Äôs callous management because, as set forth above, the electronic records do not lie and a minimal effort would have absolved me of any wrongdoing. 
Lefty-Esq."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I pay for tinder gold and they biggest reason I do is for the free monthly boost (which used to be weekly). went to go use my free monthly boost and it said I now have 0 and instead of telling me how many days I have left till my next free one, it only gives me an option to pay for extras. 

Tinder does not notified paying customers when it just takes away the services they pay for."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"This app has become unusable. I‚Äôve subscribed to gold and at the moment I‚Äôm getting notifications for messages and matches and not seeing any of them. I‚Äôve restarted, reinstalled, and even reset settings and it‚Äôs not working. What are y‚Äôall doing?"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Super shady that you can‚Äôt open an account without a legitimate phone number. What a waste. You‚Äôre as high as a kite if you think I‚Äôm going to give out my number to you for you to go and sell it. 
What a garbage company!"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Bans you for no reason and the people on it have ugly personalities
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Doesn‚Äôt work well at al
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I was on this site for 5 months paid for subscriptions and everything and one day I woke up and they banned me. I asked why several times and they never gave me a reason. They kept sending me a list of rules which I did not break. Please be careful spending money on this app. I sincerely believe they only banned me because I wasn‚Äôt paying for anymore subscriptions. I followed every rule!
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I called a girl mommy and she called me a pervert
tinder,us,12.1.0,4,"Solid app , too many bots , if there‚Äôs a way to clean up the fake accounts that‚Äôd be dope"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"If you‚Äôre a guy and you‚Äôre not tall,rich,athletic, or extremely good looking then don‚Äôt even bother.
Most girls who join this app do not join with an open mind and just hope to get Adam Levine or Chris Hemsworth look alikes....."
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,"The app overall is good. I would like to see them fix the ‚Äúmaximum distance‚Äù setting so it actually works. It didn‚Äôt matter what you set it to, you will see a ton of profiles that are 50, 100, or 1000 miles away or more. Also, I would like to see less fake profiles. They are easy to spot: profile is basically two pictures and a Snapchat username. And they re-use the same Snapchat username in multiple profiles."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I have been on this app for about 2 years just looking for friends and what not. I purchased tinder gold 3 months ago and was satisfied with the features. But it seems in the last 2 months the app has gotten to the point that I can‚Äôt even text 2 people without the app freezing. I have to force close the app and reopen it like every minute for me to get a text out before it crashes again. The swiping feature seems to work ok but the messaging is horrible. It‚Äôs been like this for a while and I figured they would fix it soon but it keeps getting worse every update. I will be canceling my subscription at the end of the month because I am paying $15 for an app I can‚Äôt even use.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Censorship and robots. It‚Äôs a waste of time, don‚Äôt bother."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"My top pick selection is always awful, I‚Äôm always running into issues with getting banned, customer service is absolutely useless"
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"First of all, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just my version or Bc my iPhone is old but the app doesn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs so buggy. It won‚Äôt load my messages or show any of my recent matches or messages. It doesn‚Äôt scroll up, it‚Äôs annoying I‚Äôm about ready to delete it but I liked tinder more than another dating app. And I‚Äôm lonely so I just want to talk to peopleü§£"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Much of these profiles are fake and have SnapChat and Instagram promotion for people to advertise their sexual content on those platforms.  I can‚Äôt imagine how Apple is making this application an ‚ÄúEditor‚Äôs Choice‚Äù.  This app is just full of people advertising drugs and wanting ‚Äúsugar daddy‚Äôs‚Äù.  Apple should remove the app due to all the illegal activity.
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,Wont load /lags. Can‚Äôt even swipe or anything. Only happens on this app.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I send out messages and don‚Äôt get any responses. If you‚Äôd like me to think about purchasing a subscription to this site you‚Äôd think I would get more responses first.
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,"Like the title states everything was fine and dandy until my account got randomly terminated. No reasoning was given, I was following the code of conduct and not being weird. Of course I‚Äôm of legal age as well."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"So I have been using tinder for a long time and just recently it has been glitching on my iPhone 10 ( slow or unresponsive, freezing, having to use the same gesture several times, messages not showing in the app) can anyone tell me why?"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Woman can do whatever they want if they lie and you get banned there‚Äôs no appeal. It‚Äôs like politics these days guilty before proven
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"i redownloaded the app a couple weeks ago, and at first it was fine but now it‚Äôs annoying being on the app because it‚Äôs go glitchy now. i can‚Äôt respond to matches or anything, please fix this!!"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,my app keeps freezing and i don‚Äôt know why. it isn‚Äôt my phone or anything. as soon as i exit the app everything is fine. please help!
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,There‚Äôs a ton of fake profiles and the app is way too glitchy. I got one of their secret admirer mini games and it forced me to skip because every card I clicked on did nothing.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"The biggest problem with all social Apps is to hiring teams in somewhere like India, China, Phillippine and etc to send invitations or some messages to the users to show the app is working well and usable. And at the end you face spanking too much time and money with no outcome."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,No one is real
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,The title says it all and the inability to appeal the weird bans makes it worse.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I‚Äôve had this app for years and I even subscribed monthly. I wanted to restart and choose matches over again so I deleted my account and when I tried to make a new one it said I was banned. Secs have done nothin to stop this. The app is full of fake pages . It should delete accounts if people don‚Äôt log in after a month. And I have not recieved any response as to why my page is banned for no reason
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,The app was literally deleted off of my phone. I re download it and I‚Äôm banned... for no reason
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I used Tinder back in 2019 and now I‚Äôm back after 2 years. All I see is ads, fake profiles promoting their insta/snapchat, and Tinder encouraging and manipulating customers in paying more and more. You have to pay for unlimited likes, pay to get read receipts, pay to see who liked you, and worst of all pay to get boosts. Boosts?! Seriously? I‚Äôm not impressed with the changes honestly. I understand that the company wants to make money, but having to pay for read receipts and boosts is just ridiculous. Also, I‚Äôm a good looking guy and all I got has been 5-6 matches after 2 weeks even though I am close to 3-4 big colleges and I used to get 50-60 matches in the past. They just want you to pay for the boosts. Tinder cares too much about the profit and too little about customer‚Äôs experience. We‚Äôll see how that‚Äôs gonna work out for them in the long run."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,No explanation or appeal! NO CUSTOMER SERVICE contact or anyone to assist. Unethical and bias!
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"There is no contact number and the email support is effectively a copy paste automated system. There is zero support if you‚Äôre unjustly banned. They ban your account so you‚Äôre forced to make a new one, which often means spending more money. The ban system is just a sneaky way of scamming users."
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,The app glitches all the time and shuts off. Gets very annoying.
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"Explain to me as to why your app has been SLOW and constantly freezing. Matches pop back up ( as new ones ) from months ago, years even. I‚Äôm sick of always being asked ‚Äúwould you like to super like so and so?‚Äù Every two swipes to the right. Speaking of swiping right... The app has been claiming that people have liked me, and they never pop up in my feed‚Äî I‚Äôve changed the distance, along with the age. Still they never show. Really considering on deleting the app here soon. I just can‚Äôt do it anymore.."
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,If I could just not have a message pop up after every time I like someone saying ‚ÄúYOuVE LIKed a PoPUlar USER blah blah blah upgrade your message blah blah blah spend more money blah ‚Äú. That would be great
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"My first chat is an advertisement for tinder premium? That I can‚Äôt dismiss? Kind of crude. Also the app can be MUCH laggier than every other application I have, and matches are sometimes in an odd order (e.g. I‚Äôll see a very old match‚Äôs conversation at the top of my chat list)."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Horrible they banned my account for literally no reason!!!! And you can never use tinder again after you‚Äôve been banned they don‚Äôt even offer a appeal to unbanned you
tinder,us,12.1.0,5,Matched on 2/16/2021 at 8:31pm; had a continuum of orgasms on 2/17/2021 12:32am.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Tinder banned my account for no reason. The same thing happened to two female friends of mine. There‚Äôs no appeals process whatsoever, which is incredibly frustrating. 

And I was a paying customer. What a disappointment."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I was kicked off about a year ago no explanation why cannot log back in??? What the ???
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I never got to make an account because every number I get is banned before I even use it! They need a system for resetting phone numbers on the app or stop requiring it. Soon, no one will be able to use the app"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I can‚Äôt tell if the likes sent (that give you the option to super like on platinum) disappear after a week even if you don‚Äôt super like them. I don‚Äôt want to super like them and look desperate, but I don‚Äôt want my likes to disappear for them either. And i like girls that look a lot like the type I‚Äôve been with though out my life but I‚Äôm not getting any matches"
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"It‚Äôs way too expensive for what you get. Trust me, just stick to the free version."
tinder,us,12.1.0,4,"Okay so I just started using tinder global, dropped my pin in Russia, because why not, and I definitely don‚Äôt speak Russian, I‚Äôve always lived in CA, so I‚Äôm matching with Russian chicks cool, but, you can‚Äôt copy and paste into google translate."
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,Fun app but the new feature quick chat is not functioning for me at all. I can not even get started on it. Please fix. Would be 4-5 stars if that was working.
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,"You guys need to fix it. The app runs slow, it takes hours to load. It‚Äôs very annoying. All other apps that I use are fast, but I have to close tinder over and over again just to type in a message."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I haven‚Äôt had tinder in months I switched ohone carriers and even deactivated my account and canceled my subscriptions but I‚Äôm still being billed for it
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,"Hey, i like the app and have been using it for a short while, however, the age range function is not working properly for me. Ive set it to a certain age minimum (22) but i keep getting prospects of 1-3 years younger than what i set (18-21y/o). I do not want someone who isn't even old enough to know what they want, let alone drink, so please fix this. Thanks!"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Facilidad de traducci√≥n de idiomas
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,The app bans you for no particular reason and doesn‚Äôt give any way of challenging the decision. Sad and undemocratic.
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"the app is fine it‚Äôs the base for everyone dating app. Where I have an issue is when people like me get banned, for NO REASON and will never get an explanation or my account back. I logged out of the account because I was dating someone and then once we didn‚Äôt work out I tried downloading it again and then BOOM banned, they don‚Äôt care and they won‚Äôt help you get your account back. Can‚Äôt make a new one because your number is attached to the account and they do let you use numbers from ‚Äútext now‚Äù apps and etc. good app, weird developer decisions."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Screw this app. I‚Äôd been a paying member for a while throughout the last few years. A couple weeks ago, tinder decided to ban my account without even giving me the reason, in the middle of a $30 / month membership, without any sort of refund or explanation why I got banned. When emailing customer support, their only response was that they don‚Äôt offer appeals. What about refunds?!? If you‚Äôre gonna cancel my membership mid month, I should get half my membership cost back at the very least. Bunch of crooks"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I really loved this app and was enjoying my time on it, but it started glitching so badly and I had to remake my account! After that, I went from 1,300 matches to 0. Every time I log onto it, it says no likes. Yet I have people messaging me on Snapchat saying they matched with me and left a message. Absolutely insane. I‚Äôd say stick with bumble; any app is better than tinder right now."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,This is really dumb it banned me when I Litterally just logged back in after a couple months of not using it and idk why I got banned u guys need to fix this problem right away it is not okay to do this FIX IT!
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with tinder now .. it‚Äôs running at the speed of dial up internet. It‚Äôs annoying plus I‚Äôm a platinum member.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,My account was banned because I had information that was against the privacy policy. But it won‚Äôt let me make a new one so I can just not have that stuff on it anymore. We should be able to create a new account with the same number and if violation occurs again then the profile gets deleted again. Or banned for 30 days not forever. I had one link on there and now I‚Äôm just banned forever. Doesn‚Äôt seem fair.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"In Puerto Rico your phone number can either start with 787 or 939, mine starts with 787 but it only gives me the 939 option."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Muy malo. No sirve para nada. Aqu√≠ la gente crea perfiles por publicar y ya
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Garbage loaded with bots
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I‚Äôve had this app for months now and the app is always glitchy and always crashes. It‚Äôs absolutely horrible and they‚Äôve done nothing to change how unfriendly it is to use.
tinder,us,12.1.0,5,As i said in totel best page to meet someone easy uncomplicated way
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"If you choose to reset your account 2-4 times in a lifetime and you get penalized for it, it‚Äôs lame. 

There are far better dating apps out there (Hinge, Bumble, OKcupid).

Don‚Äôt waste your time on this one (also has a bunch of bots and fake profiles)."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Scammers, sugar babies, self-promoters, and gold diggers!"
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,From my experience 50-70 percent of profiles are fake or advertising to get mor followers.  These profiles should be shut down and monitored  but seems they are not.
tinder,us,12.1.0,5,"it‚Äôs so great, the end."
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,Why does every update make this app slower and less useable? No one cares about stupid animations and novelty features.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,They banned my account for no reason then wouldn‚Äôt give me any information on why they did. And this isn‚Äôt the first time they have banned my account. I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I really enjoyed this app went to log on and banned. :(
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Why is the app freezing constantly on my iPhone And bluestacks, And my devices arent slow, the app is freezing my phone And PC r not"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"When I go on to app, when I open a msg, it‚Äôs usually stuck on that screen for 30 seconds before it allows me to tap my screen again and reveal the keyboard. The app is not functioning well."
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"The overall app is fine in regards to content, my main issue is the intense lag I get from writing messages and even matching, this only happened with the newer update. If there could be a way to fix this problem I would gladly continue using!"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I spent a lot of money on this app...months of subscriptions. Tinder banned me because I signed into my friend‚Äôs phone (because mine died), and forgot to sign out. When I got my phone charged back up and got back on the app, it told me I was banned. They do not do appeals, but they allow fakes and scammers on the app. I would subscribe again if they would just allow me to create another account. But at this time, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend Tinder to anyone."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I updated this app and now when a new match messages me I can only see the preview it won‚Äôt show the entire message. I‚Äôve tried logging out, reinstalling the AP, taking it off wifi and nothing seems to work!"
tinder,us,12.1.0,5,"I would like to thank Tinder for allowing me to experience Tinder Passport free of charge when the pandemic began in spring. I‚Äôve made so many friends, even close friends that I talk to daily in other countries such as Bolivia and Mexico. This is an app that allowed my to broaden my horizon and learn about new cultures and language. It allowed me to significantly improve my Spanish as well. However, there‚Äôre a few things that I hope are improved on. Such as age, I accidentally made myself a year older and cannot change it back without deleting my account and losing thousands of matches. I have tinder silver (the latest) edition and I‚Äôm glad I do get a lot of matches, but the loading time for the matches when I log in is too long. But thanks for making such a great app. Nonetheless, it‚Äôs AMAZING!"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,You missed a match. Secret admirer. Top picks. They are just scamming people now.
tinder,us,12.1.0,5,I found some friends on here and there so ‚Äúnice‚Äù to me lol hahahhahahame bdhdhhshshshshshdhdhgdgdgdgdg
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"The give you a notification saying you have a new like when you actually don't, they just want you to open the app. üëéüèæüëéüèæ"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,ive been banned for no reason!! i had the app maybe 3 days & boom!! banned? why ??
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I got banned from this site and they didn‚Äôt even tell me why. No warning. No nothing. Just checked one day and was banned. I wasn‚Äôt doing anything, showed respect to everyone, made clear my intentions, and unmatched with anyone I didn‚Äôt seem fit. And they just randomly decided to ban me with no warning. Completely dissatisfied, hurt, and disgusted."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Tinder used to be a great place to meet people. Now it‚Äôs just fake profiles and people trying to boost their social media following. 

Don‚Äôt plan on receiving any type of customer support, if you have a legit concern/complaint. It‚Äôs all automated, worthless information."
tinder,us,12.1.0,5,Y‚Äôall came in clutch for my boy AK at thot o‚Äôclock earlier!
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I literally never wrote a review in my life but I got banned for literally no reason ! I had just downloaded tinder back because I wasn‚Äôt using it for a while and when I got back on there a few hours later I was banned. I tried to email them but they sent the same email saying how they don‚Äôt accept appeals , like how does that even work ? They‚Äôre so lazy that they use the same email in response to everything and they don‚Äôt even take the time out to solve the problem or point out what you did wrong they just send you to the terms and conditions , which I‚Äôve read and didn‚Äôt violate . Please don‚Äôt even use it"
tinder,us,12.1.0,5,Wish it got me more sex more often
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"My account got banned although I did not break any of the agreements, and now I am unable to recover my account and have lost contact with my matches..."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I tried logging back into my account and noticed that I was banned. Didn‚Äôt receive a explanation as to why I was banned. I‚Äôm unable to appeal the ban. Completely unfair considering that multiple people can report a profile as an act of revenge against someone for rejecting them. Tinder do better
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Im Not able to swipe at all? ‚ÄúUnable to connect to App Store‚Äù is all I get. Can‚Äôt use the app. Tried turning off my phone, re downloading. But nothing works"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Push notifications that are promotional (super boost). Tons of fake profiles. Also: This app is just a big party filled with bugs and little glitches. I have ghost notifications in app for a year now that haven‚Äôt been cleared and cannot be cleared. Finally, not sure why but this app gets me the fewest matches out of all the others. Tinder was great in 2014. Most of its competitors are better now."
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,I pay for tinder platinum. Each month I get one free boost. EVERY MONTH I accidentally click on it when I‚Äôm swiping. I waste my boost at bad times of the day. So frustrating! Put a warning/confirmation before activating a boost. Jeez!
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,So buggy I almost can‚Äôt even message anyone back. I used to pay for premium but it‚Äôs not really worth it. They don‚Äôt really care about you on this app whether you pay for their services or not.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"aye ima need yall to unban my account. yall messing with the motion, no flex"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I had this app for a week, uploaded my pictures and all. Just to get banned because supposedly my pictures are fake. I verified my profile for gods sake. Who else could it be other than me!! Absolute trash app!!!"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"So to start off, I used to have Tinder Gold/Plus for years. I had 2500+ matches then was randomly banned one day, even after being a verified user. Alright, so I made another account but it‚Äôs still terrible. There is no customer service, a bunch of fake bots/profiles, and now advertisements on the application. This used to be fine, but now I would never download it again. Truly awful user interface."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,They should of left it alone. The new update is supper laggy. Freezes alot
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Yeah this app is by far the worse. I was banned from my account for no apparent reason. Then when I contact support to get it back. I was told I couldn‚Äôt so yeah if I could give a negative zero I would.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"The only question in my mind is; is tinder paying people to answer profiles or are they inundated with fake bot profiles? I always ask a question in my opening line. 9/10 times I get a response that has nothing to do with a question. A couple of times I told people buh bye, and they replied back for my phone number."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"‚Ä¢ The same people over and over again, even after you‚Äôve swiped left, right or super liked.
‚Ä¢ Endless fake profiles.
‚Ä¢ Non-stop prompts to purchase more and more in-app ‚Äúextras‚Äù.
‚Ä¢ Messages delete out of nowhere.
Absolute garbage."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,And garbage. So buggy.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"This app keeps getting worse. I literally reached out to costumer service because I wasn‚Äôt getting new matches, couldn‚Äôt message people, and then I decided to delete my account and start over but it wouldn‚Äôt let me delete the account. Customer service responded back that my account appeared to be working just fine. This was of no help. I responded back with screenshots of the issues I was having. They been banned my account. üôÑüò° what in the world??? No exclamation. I can‚Äôt appeal it. What a joke. No wonder other apps are doing much better than this one."
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,Honestly just make Tinder gold free and get rid of the fake accounts cause tinder gold is just a waste of money. Nobody is going to pay for that
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I pay for premium and I can‚Äôt even check my messages because the app is moving to slow it‚Äôs unusable please fix this.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I am unable to make a Tinder account with my phone number, because my number is banned. But the problem is, I am not the person who was banned on Tinder. I haven‚Äôt ever even had a Tinder account before!!!!! Whoever had my phone number before me must have been banned from Tinder, but I have never used Tinder before. I tried to contact customer service and tell them that I haven‚Äôt even had my phone number for a year yet - I‚Äôve only had it for a few months, and in those months, I haven‚Äôt made a Tinder account, so there should be no reason why *I* am banned, because *I* have never had a Tinder account before, but Tinder customer service won‚Äôt listen to me when I try to tell them that I AM NOT THE ONE WHO WAS BANNED FROM TINDER!!! The number was, but I haven‚Äôt even had this number for a year, and I haven‚Äôt had a Tinder account before, and have never tried to make a Tinder account before, because I was in a long-term relationship up until last month. I don‚Äôt know how many ways I have to say that I WAS NOT THE PERSON WHO WAS BANNED FROM TINDER!!!!"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Needs to allow unbanning accounts. I got banned for no reason. And  I just wanna get my account back I tried to make a new account from a different phone but it‚Äôs still linked to my old account. It‚Äôs ridiculous bc I got banned bc of what my ex did on my profile. I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying for the app but the restrictions are just kinda stupid
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,I was bored and had nothing else to do
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"App constantly glitches, swiping on one person takes 10 seconds for the swipe to actually register. Most of the women on the  app are robots or girls trying to sling their onlyfans or their Snapchat‚Äôs. Tinder offering to boost your likes all but tells you, their likes algorithm won‚Äôt let your like go through unless pay more money for it. Their original app worked flawlessly, this one is just a joke."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Tinder claims you can use this app for free but it‚Äôs a LIE!!! With the free version, you can‚Äôt even see who likes you and you can‚Äôt read any messages you receive, so what‚Äôs the point in having a free option? So then I upgraded to Tindr Plus and I see NO new features! I still can‚Äôt read my messages or see who likes me!!! What‚Äôs the bloody point??? Biggest ripoff app EVER!!!"
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"This thing is constantly glitching, crashing, or lagging and it drives me up the wall. You should probably fix it or do something about it."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Far behind many other apps with this in regards
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Many fake accounts and a poor authentication system
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,"Everytime I open tinder it feels like it isn‚Äôt optimized at all, I constantly get stuffer when navigating through the menus and half the time my phone gets really hot for no Reason while using the tinder app. Btw I have a iPhone 11 Pro on the latest iOS update so please fix the bugs causing my phone to heat up and my app to stop stuttering."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Not a good app. Crashes a lot, doesn‚Äôt allow you to see who likes you for free it obviously should be free since no one wants to pay for a app that crashes, it crashes on the new fast chat a lot doesn‚Äôt allow you to connect through fast chat quickly with anyone, the super like limits of one every how many hours is sorta wack just needs to be better in everything."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,you‚Äôll pay for a membership and they‚Äôll STILL ban you for NO reason. even if you‚Äôre following rules! app is super glitchy too. don‚Äôt waste your time or money!!
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Tinder is gender noninclusive and would immediately ban you and keep your purchases without a warning. This not fair to the users who have done nothing wrong other than being different than the norm. 
There are way better apps than Tinder. It also glitches way too many times and freezes and restarts for no reason. I dont even understand why it glitches when it doesnt even offer half the features bumble, hinge or other apps have. This app is crap. Save your money and save your time."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,The ‚Äúsecret admirer‚Äù add seemed like a decent way to make sure you matched with people every once in awhile. But I guess tinder developers decided it would just tell you ‚Äúbetter luck next time‚Äù no matter which of the four you choose every time instead. Amazing how you can have 20+ likes and rarely match or lose any no matter how often you use the app. Used to be the best ‚Äúdating‚Äù app but it‚Äôs become a cash grab.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I have tinder gold, I set my radius bar to 30 miles and every girl in my stack 60-70 miles away. Why have a mike radius if it‚Äôs not gonna be accurate or actually work. Tinder needs to do something about this or I‚Äôm unsubscribing"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I got the ban hammer the moment I logged in with FB. No reason given and no appeal allowed. Don‚Äôt waste your intimate info on this garbage app.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Starting to think this app is a scam I purchase gold three different times never get any good matches and the people I‚Äôll be matching with be terrible no where close to my type and for me to find a decent match I have to continue to buy boots thenI‚Äôll get a decent match just for them not to respond I‚Äôm tired of this app
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I‚Äôve been a member for a bit now, and find myself CONSTANTLY getting banned.. I have an extremely modest account i‚Äôm over the age of 18, and men report me for not answering or saying no to lewd acts. YOU GUYS need to do better when screening reports. YOUR BANNING THE WRONG PEOPLE with no chance of rebuttal."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Downloaded and was banned in a few hours? I hadn‚Äôt talked to, or even finished filling out my account. Thinking this is a blessing in disguise though."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I went to log into tinder to find the chats between my wife (now) when we first met through tinder. Hadn‚Äôt used tinder for 4 years prior to that since we started dating. And it won‚Äôt let me on. I am permanently banned for finding a match in tinder then deleting tinder for 4 years. I can‚Äôt even get out texts from them. And they won‚Äôt respond why they banned me.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I feel like there is constant bugs. Mine is constantly lagging and it‚Äôs to the point I don‚Äôt even wanna bother opening the app anymore
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Half of the things you have to pay for. even for messaging them you have to get a membership.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,This app is just a disgrace
tinder,us,12.1.0,4,"I can‚Äôt believe how awesome this app is! I no longer have to worry about meeting people in person, I can just swipe through dozens of photos until I find the perfect one"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Updated to newest version and it deleted all 300 of my matches, including some I wanted to talk to. Nice."
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,Mexicana
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,:(
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,Idk why but this app was bugging me a lot. From the morning it‚Äôs been continuously telling me to verify as a human and I‚Äôve already done it a several times and still it‚Äôs not giving me the access.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Tinder should make profile verification a requirement. Nobody should be allowed to create an account and start swiping without proving that they are who they say that they are first. This will help people avoid being scammed or catfished. There‚Äôs too many people creating thousands of fake profiles and Tinder should have been on top of that years ago. Every other account on Tinder is not real and that absolutely should not be the case. This app is also incredibly racist. I never find women of color in my top picks. You know why? It‚Äôs because Tinder has an algorithm that only places white women there. There‚Äôs no room for anybody else. It‚Äôs always skinny Barbie white women and maybe a random white-passing Hispanic woman but she‚Äôs only there because she looks like she could be white. I‚Äôve found several blog post addressing this topic and it further more proves my point and confirmed my suspicion. If you‚Äôre a person of color using Tinder, you‚Äôre definitely wasting your money if you‚Äôre using the paid version. There‚Äôs going to be a lot of racist white people swiping left on your account because of your skin color. That automatically will lower your desirability rating in Tinder‚Äôs idiotic algorithm. Ergo, your account will be viewed a lot less your account is automatically being viewed a lot less than a white person‚Äôs would. The good people over at Tinder‚Äôs HQ couldn‚Äôt care less about anyone making a genuine connection. It‚Äôs all about money at the end of the day. Don‚Äôt give them yours!"
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,Please give me a ‚Äòcreate folders‚Äô option in my chat so I can manage all my matches - thanks!
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,"So I‚Äôve been using tinder for awhile and I have my radius set for 10 miles and yet I‚Äôve matched with incredibly handsome men. How am I gonna kiss them all when they‚Äôre 400+ miles away? Rude, homophobic and truly annoying. I don‚Äôt have the global setting so why am I matching with people from France and Australia when I‚Äôm in the US??"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,What happened to this app? It‚Äôs so laggy on my phone. I figured my phone might be messed up but it‚Äôs happening on my iPad too. And it‚Äôs much more powerful than my phone. Please fix this!
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,Top picks don‚Äôt match my likes. And I don‚Äôt believe that all the accounts on here are real ones.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Ever since installing this app my iphone 12 freezes and is slower then the iphone 7 that i upgraded from. I recommend using it on safari.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,After having my calendar for 2-3 months and I got banned for no reason and since I don‚Äôt have an appeal process which I don‚Äôt understand I can‚Äôt get back on the app all they told me was to sign up through my Facebook but that doesn‚Äôt work this needs to be fixed
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,cannot get unbanned I was on the app for 2days and my account was banned my bio was date me please and no bad photos customer support did not help I recommend SKOUT you get just as many matches and you don‚Äôt get banned like stupid tinder
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"App‚Äôs garbage. Super slow, freezes all the time, and crashes nonstop."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"They‚Äôre consistently banning accounts and giving no reason whatsoever, even with following all of the terms and guidelines. Not only did this happen to me, it‚Äôs happened to over a dozen other people I know. They‚Äôre also not giving you an option to dispute the ban. The majority of the profiles are of members promoting themselves with their IG, premium snap, Only Fans, and even adding in their Venmo or cash app username. If it‚Äôs not one of those, members don‚Äôt respond to messages or just want to hookup. It‚Äôs not worth it."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,My account got banned for no apparent reason and there‚Äôs no solution to unban it or create a new account!!! Without another Number!!!!
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,i got a membership and got banned for no reason and can‚Äôt even get back into the appüôÑ
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"So I don‚Äôt normally leave reviews but this app is just so awful and frustrating to use I felt almost obligated to warn others. Half the time the app is useless as it will begin to freeze up as you‚Äôre typing up messages, forcing you to restart the app just to be able to send the message, also risking what part of the message you were somehow able to type suddenly disappearing. The message system is also just outdated and useless in general. Would not recommend unless you want to spend 20 extra minutes trying to craft and send a message to someone else."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I never write reviews but last week I deleted tinder for good since they want to change their terms and condition. Now they force you to select boxes that allow them to share your personal information to them and 3rd party countries and violate your privacy. 

NO GOOD U SHOULDNT BE FORCED TO HAVE YOUR PRIVACY SHARED AND VIOLATED JUST TO SWIPE #BIGFAIL"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I was banned for this app for no reason, and when I tried to appeal they informed me that there were no appeals... extremely frustrating that there is no phone number to call, only email"
tinder,us,12.1.0,5,"Just spent our first Valentine‚Äôs Day together. Have faith y‚Äôall, this is like applying for jobs. You‚Äôll have a few bad ones or vice versa. Stick with it and don‚Äôt be a creep most of all. This app has a lot to offer. 

6 months after the right swipe (he actually super liked me lol) and I can‚Äôt believe it but I‚Äôm actually gonna say thank you to Tinder for coming through for me and bringing the most amazing, most supportive, funniest, sexiest, sweetest person into my life. I used Tinder in 3 countries for 3 years and, yes, I met absolute SCUM on this app. But I also met my favorite person on it. Of course you can always meet people other ways/on other apps, but you could also get lucky like we did. ‚ù§Ô∏è Protect your heart, don‚Äôt tolerate any disrespect, love yourself first, and good luck with your journey. ‚ù§Ô∏èTanks Tinder:) from both of us."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Let us unban ourselves :(
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"A vibrant, user-friendly, kitschy magnet for shallow vapid people to prove that they are more attractive and more popular than you. Tinder is extremely rigid in the way that you can connect with people. The new features allow somewhat easier contact ,but be prepared to spend a paycheck on any premium benefits. In a world where it‚Äôs not safe to go out and meet people, it has become a mainstay instead of a convenient option. I‚Äôve probably had 15 separate accounts on here now, and it‚Äôs seldom Led to anything fulfilling. Stay away unless you‚Äôre in Greek Life or selling your Onlyfans."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Unless if you‚Äôre really really attractive you‚Äôll do fine on this horrendous app. For the average guy you‚Äôll just find your self swiping right with no luck. You‚Äôre better of going to Target and picking up chicks there. Also you can get banned for no reason without an appeal.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Not to be arrogant/douche, but how am I not matching with more attractive women..."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"My friend tried to sign in to his banned account on my phone and got my SIM card permanently banned, thanks PVT Forbes."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I purchased gold, and I can‚Äôt even use it. I can‚Äôt swipe and I can‚Äôt chat because it‚Äôs so slow. Nothing works. I‚Äôve tried restarting, deleting and redownloading, even switched devices and nothing. I just want my money back"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"It‚Äôs pay to play, us ugly boys don‚Äôt stand a chance namean?"
tinder,us,12.1.0,5,Met me a lil side piece in there
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,"Maybe a user error, however I feel like the security of tinder can be better to prevent fake profiles from creating an account.

Maybe I‚Äôll go to another app to find compatibility, all I seem to filter through is bots and anxiety when wanting to break the ice when I do match once in a new moon.

Thanks for any help."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I was happy with the app until my account was hacked, my information stolen and I was locked out of my own account while it was being used to deceive other users. I had proof of this from the start and I even sent the proof to customer support IMMEDIATELY. My account was reported for being fraudulent since those who hacked it were using it to defraud other people who I had been talking to and anyone else they interacted with. My account was reported several times and then permanently banned. I sent several more urgent complaints with proof of what I knew had happened and I didn‚Äôt hear back from customer support for over 2 months. When they finally responded all they said was ‚Äúyour account was reported for fraudulent activity and was banned.‚Äù Yeah, thanks. Obviously they didn‚Äôt even read what I‚Äôd written several times about what had happened. To add insult to injury, they still charged me after the account I was locked out of was banned! Good luck getting that money back if this ever happens to you!! 
The really disheartening part of all of this is that there were people I was interacting with on the app before this happened who I was really enjoying getting to know and with whom there may have been a future. That is right up to the point that my account was hacked and they were made to believe I was a fraud all along and I was absolutely powerless to stop it. Thanks Tinder support for absolutely NOTHING!! 
My advice: if you‚Äôre talking to someone you like, get their number immediately and take the conversation off Tinder immediately. Or, better yet, just use a different app that actually cares about their customers."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"it glitches so badly. it‚Äôs so touch sensitive. nothing works. takes ages to load then once it loads, nothing works for like twenty minutes. it‚Äôs crazy and I pay for premium..?"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Many profiles are easily concluded to be fake, or just women promoting their Instagram and trying to get followers on other platforms. You‚Äôll also find that your deck will be filled with transgenders. Tinder needs to stop being lazy and create more options of wanted features of the deck. People that pay, shouldn‚Äôt be bombarded with transgender cards, if they want nothing to do with it. I‚Äôve reported so many fake profiles in hopes to have them removed to help melt fellow man, and Tinder does nothing about it because is really them being constantly recycled in the deck. Tinder needs a better algorithm for targeting and removing fake profiles, promoters who won‚Äôt respond after they match with you, as well as more options of what we choose to have in our deck. It‚Äôs a paid service, yet you don‚Äôt do much to serve, aside from shoving fake profiles on us, not responding to reported profiles, and having little to no options for what we see in the deck. Fixing all of these issues would narrow down the decks. If you fixed your code, I might continue paying. But with how you run things, you‚Äôve lost a paid subscriber."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Can‚Äôt trust the females on here. They just want your money.
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"99/100 of my matches of obese/borderline obese women. I am not attracted to large women, I like skinny or athletic. As a Tinder Gold user, I expect filters for weight or body type. I am getting tired of getting excited every time I get a new match only to find out they‚Äôre fat."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Spent hundreds of dollars of this app not to be even told why I got banned. Judging from all the people on here complaining about being banned you guys need to fix your process clearly your banning system is not working. Pretty sure I got banned just for saying I was in a band I can see that being ‚Äúpromotional‚Äù
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Got harassed by a guy outside the app... pretty sure he reported my profile, because now I‚Äôm banned and no one will give me a single reason why."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Tinder was working amazing for me for almost 3 years. Tried logging in one day as usual and it says my account got banned. I have no idea why, I followed all of tinders terms and conditions. I never even got a warning. I‚Äôve heard of this being done to other users a lot more than what I expected. I still don‚Äôt know why I got banned. I never got reasoning and there‚Äôs no way for me to make an appeal."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Can i get unbanned already it's been over 5 months now.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"If cancer had an app.
Don‚Äôt listen to fake comments. 
This app is beyond bad"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,This app is Soo buggy I cannot believe I‚Äôm paying for a membership!!!!!
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Their algorithm makes men want to buy their services to see people that liked them. Majority of profit comes from manipulation of men‚Äôs feelings and giving them false hope. It‚Äôs pretty messed up. They are just trying to stack money which is their job, but they should change their mission statement."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Let me start with I love tinder. I think its the best and most appealing dating app available, tinder is simply iconic rather you like it or not. I used tinder for years and eventually met my boyfriend of almost 3 years. Well we are no longer together so i decided to download tinder again. I was on it for about 6 months and I was promoted to verify my identity with a license or passport etc. Oddly enough the previous day I had a few different people message me and harassing me because they said I was lying about my age... So I ignored them and the following day was hit with the verification thing. So I put 2 and 2 together and figured they had reported my account for being ‚Äúunderage‚Äù and knowing that im not underage I provided tinder with my drivers license... then later that day my account was banned.... Ive tried several times to make an appeal and reach out to the support team. With just my luck I get that same B.S. automated email about ‚Äúsorry it seems your account is banned and theres nothing they can do at this time‚Äù blah blah blah... So now my love life is depressing and confined to using grinder üôÉ if you didn‚Äôt already know... theres no finding love on grinder. üòÇ so like whats up tinder?? whats up with this wrongfully banned accounts I notoriously hear about (including my own) on top of that Tinders contact team is 0/10. They are awful. They need to fire and hire people that will actually do their jobs and not send automated emails because they‚Äôre lazy."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,disappointed with the app
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,did nothing wrong and got banned
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I got into a relationship so I bud my profile and deleted my pictures and info like my bio and college. I got out of the relationship and decided I wanted to get back on tinder only to find that I‚Äôm banned? I don‚Äôt know what for as I don‚Äôt think I ever violated any guidelines and they won‚Äôt even give me the reason I was banned
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I got banned for no reason while my account was hacked. It is ridiculous that there is no appeal system.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I had tinder downloaded for a few months but then deleted it like 2 weeks ago because I wasn‚Äôt having any luck But I still had unlimited amount of swipes.. fast forward to a couple days ago when I re-downloaded it and got signed up and now I find out you have a limited amount of swipes?! 

The only real reason I liked Tinder is because it didn‚Äôt force me to pay to see my matches or FORCE ME TO PAY FOR MORE SWIPES... Tinder you‚Äôre seriously just a money making crock!"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,This app lags WAY TOO MUCH for me!! please fix it
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,FIX YOUR APP.. like it‚Äôs a little ridiculous that everytime i get a new message from someone i have to completely uninstall it & reinstall it to read the messages.
tinder,us,12.1.0,5,"I deleted this app a long time ago when I matched with a sweet girl I really liked. We started hanging out a little bit, then we started getting serious. After a while I realized this one was certainly special. I thought this app was used for just hookups, but I was wrong. We got engaged Friday 1-12-21. I just want to thank the developers of this app, you guys are awesome."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Fake profiles. Just looking for $$ from users. Glitching platform always shows messages.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"No response, feels like no one is ever on"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"The app is so buggy and unresponsive I have to tap or swipe ten times just to open someone‚Äôs profile or move between screens. Feels like I‚Äôm using an iPhone 3g running iOS 2‚Äîoh actually those things worked fine, tinder is worse."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Banned for no reason actually ridiculous
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I can‚Äôt even use the app because it doesn‚Äôt let me upload any of my photos....
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Super glitchy
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,There are a bunch of fake people on here and it expands my search radius by itself without me doing it. Zero stars
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"This is getting ridiculous, I‚Äôm not getting any likes anymore. I wait and wait and wait to see if I get another match but I never get one or any likes. I‚Äôll change my review when this is fixed, highly disappointedüò°"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Horrible
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Banned for no reason. Followed all terms and conditions and never even received a warning like tinder says so I could fix whatever it was that apparently got me banned. Probably a snowflake that banned me
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Tinder hardly even works anymore. It takes minutes and constant tapping to get screen to screen, typing messages out, etc. the amount of spam and bugs completely ruins the experience for me. I will not put the extraneous amount of effort that the app is requiring of me for it to function. It takes legit 5 minutes to even to to a persons profile, flip through picks, swipe, and another 5 to even get the message typed out. The app constantly freezes, crashes, and has significant delays. These bugs have prolonged for over 6 months and have lost hope that the developers will correct or even care. Such a disappointment for what used to be a great app to connect with others."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Just like millions of other people I have fell victim to being banned for no reason . Crazy part is I had bought tinder gold. Waste of money .
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Apple removed my previous review.  Go figure.  This app is the worst dating app you could imagine.  If you truly want to feel lonely and awful about yourself use this at your own risk.
tinder,us,12.1.0,5,I highly recommend this app I met my boyfriend on this app
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"This app has turned to a cash grab.
It tells me i have 15 people who have liked me so i have been swiping for 3 days now and have not missed or made a connection with these 15 people.  So the only way to see who these people are is to buy Tinder gold. 
Tinder developers you are trash."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,You see the same people you swiped left and right on even when you purchase tinder gold tbh it‚Äôs a waste of money do better!
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,Everytime i have to send a message i better close it and download the app again since i doesnt let me do it normally
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"From my experience and what I‚Äôve heard from others, it‚Äôs not an uncommon thing to be banned for no reason. Tinder doesn‚Äôt explain why you were banned. In fact, the app didn‚Äôt even tell me I was banned, and I had to log in on the website. Only then did I learn I was banned- months after trying to get customer support to help me figure out why my log-in wasn‚Äôt working. 
*There is no customer support number.* There‚Äôs an email system, but you have to put in a ticket and there‚Äôs no guarantee that support will actually get back to you or be able to resolve your issue. I put in a couple support requests over two years to request info on why I was banned, and only this past year I got a ticket that was responded to. When I did, I explained that I‚Äôd never violated any of the service‚Äôs terms or guidelines. The support rep responded back with a standard acknowledgment of my request and a link to the terms of service, suggesting that they hadn‚Äôt actually read my message. When I asked the same representative what the reason for my ban was, they said that Tinder doesn‚Äôt have that information available at this time. 
*There is no appeals system.* If your phone number is banned, you can‚Äôt create a new Tinder account with that number. Making new accounts after being banned would seem to violate the terms of service anyway, so I can‚Äôt recommend that. 
This is all on top of the actual experience of using Tinder, which I can‚Äôt say is a particularly pleasant one. Unfortunately, it happens to have one of the largest dating pools of such apps, so not being able to use it or choosing not to use it is going to seriously limit your online dating experience."
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,App is very slow and crowded. Consistently freezes. And no notifications work. Back button doesn‚Äôt work sometimes
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,I just updated the app and it‚Äôs moving extra slow like the rest of my phone is fine but tinder it‚Äôs lows annoying
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Fix the app it‚Äôs slow and freezes. I pay for this app and can‚Äôt even get on it without wanting to throw my phone
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Banned for no reason... trash customer service.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,The policies are awful. I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong and yet I was banned on both twitter and bumble. I think people reported me instead of unmatching. The customer service kept saying that I violated terms of service but couldn‚Äôt tell me what I did wrong.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Hi, I‚Äôve been using tinder for a year and not a single date I was able to get in the app, I was playing it cool and taking my time talking to the girls I matched with and I really don‚Äôt understand why women have this app if there not gonna hit you up or want to go on a date. For example, there is this girl name Salma and I was able to get her number and snapchat, then everything went well but she never had time to go hangout and please if you hear or see this name she is literally boring and she makes stupid videos while not texring people. Yeah, most women I meet are super werid and they will flake on you so if your a guy I recommend go out and ask for a girls number because women in Tinder will not respond to you even if your a decent looking dude."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Wasn‚Äôt told why I was banned just happened after I cancel my subscription
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,"First: 
STOP recommending to use a super like when there aren‚Äôt any available - super annoying! 

Second:
INCLUDE features seen in Bumble, like mental well-being information and so on. 

Third: 
BUGS: Sometimes, it isn‚Äôt possible to upload additional photos to a profile. 

Tinder was never that great, but it still serves its purpose as the go-to dating app, however, Bumble seems to be the next thing."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,i‚Äôm banned lol.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Everyone here is a 5 or below...not worth it. Keeps glitching too. Yay
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Waste of time and energy :)
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,"O app est√° todo travando, por favor consertem"
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"The app freezes up very very frequently on my 2nd gen iPhone SE

Also don‚Äôt like how it tries to sell you more super likes and boosts and stuff even after you pay for the premium version."
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,"Idk why but I was banned, I don‚Äôt think tinder likes to support ugly people shame."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Got this cause I was lonely thought I could at least make some friends but now I just feel worse about myself
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,App is constantly freezing and needing to be uninstalled then installed again it gets pretty frustrating hopefully it gets fixed
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Then amount of the  fk reviews the app gives you i ridiculous
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Tinder is greedy they just want our money the app is a scam I‚Äôm going to pick up girls in real life I just got a beautiful black girl phone number in real life we are going to go out for some tacos
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Didn‚Äôt see email signup
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,Something as simple as a favorite movie or show on your profile would make conversations so much more meaningful.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Goofy tinder has some trash system for banning you for putting your beliefs and views on your bio, and they don‚Äôt agree with it. I‚Äôve met people who believe the same thing and matched with them too. If someone doesn‚Äôt agree with what I got they can swipe left and carry on. You don‚Äôt have to take my whole account for that. I tried sending an email about this and all they sent back was a pre-written email basically saying ‚Äúsorry we don‚Äôt let people get their accounts back even if it was for something simple‚Äù horrible service and I was a gold member. Y‚Äôall goofy for real."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"stupid that it didn‚Äôt even let me make acct it put todays date is my birthday now it says open and account in 6,000 days..."
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,My app won‚Äôt open after the update. Also people are quick to unmatch cuz this app isn‚Äôt for long term romance duh get with the program tinder!
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,App is a scam! Placed money in it still got no likes . Would not recommend this app!!!! I wish i can give no stars! This app is not fair if you are a guy!!!
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,There are just too many fake profiles on this app now. I love just outside the city and I know plenty of ppl that us this app yet I see almost nothing but obviously fake profiles. What‚Äôs the point of paying for an app if half the ppl there aren‚Äôt real?
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"This app is basically a trolling ground for scammers. And it wants you to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù and pay to see the same scammers that you are already accosted by. This app does not patrol or do anything when you report scammers. If you‚Äôre a woman, Tinder is NOT a safe app to be on. This is absolutely where the Ted Bundy‚Äôs lurk. Tinder doesn‚Äôt care as long as it‚Äôs making money."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I cancelled my subscription to tinder gold 3 months ago now and have since been charged 3 times. There is no support or way to get in contact with the company, and when I try to troubleshoot the problem they redirect me to Apple (who I also cannot contact). At this point I‚Äôm going to have to report this company as fraudulent to my bank just in order to get them to stop charging me."
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,Tinder really suffers from a lack of ability to adjust preferences other than age. You end up seeing people of all shapes sizes heights etc. and locations! Even though you can choose to only see people within a set range you end up seeing people form 6000 miles away. Also should allow you to change your name and age etc. at least once or twice. A lot of people join not really knowing mich about it (like me) so they enter a user name or handle and then realize they‚Äôd rather have entered their real first name.  It‚Äôs just a dumb platform all around.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"This app does not verify its users, and I recently met a con artist who is a drug dealer on it. His name is Chris and he claims he went to Columbia University-educated mathematician. He was handsome, extremely affectionate, charming, and attentive in the beginning, and he ended being an autistic, emotionally abusive, cocaine-dealing, and depressed alcoholic. Luckily I never gave him money when he tried to gain from me. I‚Äôve also ran into a lot of scammers from Africa who you can spot easily because they tell you romantic things without ever meeting them. Beware and never give anyone you meet on here money."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Tinder is.. tinder.. the app however needs so much work. There has consistently been bugs in this trash app and I really don‚Äôt understand why. The app is monetizing most of its features which is annoying too.
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,why does it take forever to load and do anything on your app? i think that part has gotten worse over time.
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"I‚Äôve been using tinder for years and I‚Äôm upset because they recently banned me. I have never used fake pictures, foul language or anything that I would think that would violate their terms of use. I tried reaching out for an answer but no reply. I‚Äôm unsure if the reason is because I deleted it to clear my matches and remade a new one but that shouldn‚Äôt be an issue either if you wanted to start fresh."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"My account was banned, the statement they included was that I violated some terms of conditions when none were violated. I think that the company committed overt Racism in banning a minority and needs to be investigated because any company that commits racism outright and without recourse should be struck down and removed from the APPLE STORE immediately. 
Tinder has committed outright racism and needs to be looked at by law enforcement."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Just like every other dating app that claims you can use it for free, you can‚Äôt.  You can swipe right all you want but you can‚Äôt see who likes or or liked you back unless you pay meaning you can‚Äôt meet ANYONE on the free version.
There are also about 90% unverified and fake accounts which tinder needs to start purging if they don‚Äôt verify within a certain amount of time."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I have been suspended and do not why, or anyway to appeal the suspension.
But that is ok but there seems to be no way of removing their app from my phone therefore I am stuck ."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I never wanted this my son keeps installing it please disable n block app
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Whatever you do, do NOT pay for this app. The more you pay the WORSE results you get. I have no idea how tinder has not been sued in a class action lawsuit yet. This app is clearly a scam designed to milk money out of users. The app literally punishes users for paying. It used to be a great dating app, now it‚Äôs literally a scam on every level."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Too bored app ü§¶üèª
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I got banned for no reason and i paid for it.I need  an explication why you did this I don‚Äôt get the point of it
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,My account got banned and I haven‚Äôt even been on it in months ü•¥ I literally downloaded it and I was banned. Didn‚Äôt have any nudity or anything ü§£
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,It‚Äôs horrible too many robots  it‚Äôs sad that you can‚Äôt use the plstform for what it‚Äôs intended to do
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Like many others, one day I signed in and saw that I am banned forever from this app. There is no way to appeal."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,It was really fun and met a lot of friends but If I could give the app 0 stars I would I got banned for no reason at all and they don‚Äôt give your account back or let you create a new one
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"First of all, there are too many dudes in the girls list, and I‚Äôm not just talking about trans. This makes no sense unless they think they‚Äôre going to convert straight guys, which we‚Äôre constantly told that‚Äôs impossible. Why not make categories for people who may actually like each other?
Second of all, most of the girls have the same trashy look and have the same boring profiles.
Third, too many girls are there for attention and follower on IG, SC, etc.
And now, Tinder is just really hamhandedly hitting you with ads and trying to get you to upgrade while luring you with fake accounts and the promise of matches with girls you have to pay to see. 
I‚Äôm no cheapskate and I‚Äôll pay for quality, but this ain‚Äôt it. Not in my area at least."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Tinder wil ban you, give you zero explanation, then leave you banned for years. What used to be a fun and reliable way to meet girls of all types with different interests became an unfortunate hub for unsuspecting males being cancelled without warning, without notice. Sadly, Tinder is the biggest and the most well known place for dating of all types but they are the opposite of a leader in society, by becoming selective in who gets to engage and enjoy dating life, which has become increasingly reliant on just one single outlet, which is mainly online, for some people, it is more than others, and dating is more online based in 2020 than ever before. In the past, we relied on a multitude of destinstions both physical and digitial in order to date and meet mates. How unfair is it that this seems like THE public square, through mostly no fault of our own, the ONLY public square for so many, yet some get banned for no good reason and don't get to date. How lacking in honor and respect for mankind. Tinder has become notoriously anti-man with a long list of cancellations, all of these cancelled people sharing the very similar story ""banned for nothing, no way around it"", with Tinder not caring what the experience is for those who have been banned."
tinder,us,12.1.0,5,The best go to late night might get lucky or not app ü§åüèªü§£
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Honestly this biggest thing I hate about this app is the fact that those numbers stay long after you‚Äôve swiped left on people. Like, get rid of them if I‚Äôm not interested. Worst feature of Tinder. I also hate the lack of options where I live. I live in a college and I get nothing"
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"I‚Äôve NEVER not see this have major bugs (used on and off again for 4 years on an array of devises). Notifications pop up weeks later (if you‚Äôre lucky. I put my snap in my bio and will get messages from people who will ask why I stopped replying on the app when a message never came up in the first place), chat boxes disappear at will, laggy keyboard. I‚Äôm not saying being a developer is easy but come on guys it‚Äôs seriously your job!"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Literally was having trouble creating an account emailed for help and I was banned. What crappy customer service
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Nothing has worked on my app for awhile now I‚Äôve missed messages that aren‚Äôt even there on the app but when I go to the website there are messages. I‚Äôve done everything deleted the app and redownloaded it I have logged out nothing has worked extremely disappointed.
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,"There is NO diversity in top picks. I don‚Äôt know what the algorithm is, but it consistently lacks diversity. Waste of money if you ask me"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Accounts all seem to be fake
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Seriously. It‚Äôs both frustrating and futile.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"What Tinder is doing is unbelievable! I‚Äôve spent so much money when I really shouldn‚Äôt have too. I‚Äôve used Tinder for many years but recently it‚Äôs gotten to a point where I‚Äôm not getting any matches at all I‚Äôve moved locations etc in the past years and it was fine , however when I moved to LA and with tinder‚Äôs updates things changed. So I changed my profile picture etc in hopes that maybe it would change/impact my results after all better photos of me should help right ?? Wrong! I still didn‚Äôt get any matches , so I tried all the other Tinder competitors Bumble , BLK , Hinge and to no surprise I was getting matches left and right. I‚Äôm an attractive guy I know this from responses from women and from ...the other apps. Even then I still decided to buy Tinder Platinum and a couple of boosts in the hopes that it betters or boosts my profile STILL NOTHING!
I‚Äôll get matches from women that are either fake profiles or very far away from even the states. With Platinum my profile is supposed to be boosted but it‚Äôs like Tinder is hiding my profile or something. I spoke to a woman who said she deleted Tinder because the same issue I‚Äôm mentioning ( I met her on BLK she‚Äôs very attractive with a large following on IG). For Tinder to hide our profiles or even MESSAGES is said ESPECIALLY WHEN I PAY pretty much $40 per month. This is the last month however , while the other apps are not as popular at least the overall quality and experience is better. 
I feel upset and ripped off by Tinder and I‚Äôll be unsubscribing and deleting this app."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Fake profiles are endless. You can report. They don‚Äôt care. Useless.
tinder,us,12.1.0,5,"Tinder is super easy to use, and I didn‚Äôt think much of it at first. I found my husband on Tinder as well. Please keep on trying, not every person is meant for you, but true love is worth looking for."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,My account got banned months ago I put in a complaint and no one has messaged me or emailed me about it it‚Äôs completely ludicrous that an app so popular has no support system for when things go off the rails and starts deleting good accounts yet literal onlyfans accounts are still floating around
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"It already happened to me twice before and now it happened again üôÑüôÑüôÑ

I don‚Äôt know why some of my matches Tinder deletes them and then it bring them back. 
Like I said, it happened to my three times but the first two times they disappeared so I thought they unmatched me but apparently that was not the case because couple of days later they appeared again on my card stack. 
I asked them if they unmatched me or what happened and they said that Tinder (for some unknown reason) deletes them. 
And it happened to me last night with this beautiful girl I was talking to and she sent me two messages and when I log in to see the messages she was not on my conversation stack. üò°üòî
I hope whatever this problem is get resolve soon cause it does not make sense that we get some matches to Tinder deletes them for no reason."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"This app is truly the worst. Using it such a pain, lags constantly, and will freeze on the regular. With as much as they charge for premium you‚Äôd think they could afford better app developers."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I pay for tinder gold and I can hardly ever use the app because my account shuts down and unmatches me with everyone and unsends the messages. Will no longer be paying.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I understand it is dangerous and predators out there. App Store needs to update and clarify this app is for 18 and up. On the App Store it says 17+. This shouldn‚Äôt be listed if you have to be 18 and up. PLease fix this
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"So I deleted the app and eventually downloaded it again, and it said my account was banned. I‚Äôm literally bamboozled, and when I try to get ahold of any one i just get robots. So yea i‚Äôm dissatisfied!"
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"I am a 82 year old male, who looks much younger. I walk everyday and go to the gym six days a week. Very rarely am I shown women 70-75 and if you do show someone, they are thousands of miles away. I would be willing to spend money for a upgrade. But what would a upgrade get me ....more of the same. Paul S Gerber"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"If you‚Äôre a trans person especially, expect a ban before getting more than 5 matches. You don‚Äôt need to even message someone. If you live in a conservative enough area expect a near instant mass reporting of your acct with no elaboration of your ban from Tinder. Kinda feels bad man"
tinder,us,12.1.0,5,Why can‚Äôt I us this
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I wish I could leave it with no stars. I got the app yesterday, didn‚Äôt really touch it at all,  didn‚Äôt swipe. I woke up this morning and I‚Äôve been banned, it‚Äôs like tinder doesn‚Äôt allow people to have different life choices and preferences in life. They see it as wrong when nothing should be seen wrong with people‚Äôs choices. Tinder is a disappointing app. They let people put noooodes in their pictures without banning them. My photos were very appropriate not against guide lines and I still wake up banned. Do not waste your time on this app."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Bots and women with 0 personalities that only promote their OF and IG. Don‚Äôt waste your time. Been on & off this app for years.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"*****THIS APP SHOULD NOT BE AN EDITORS CHOICE*******

Banned for absolutely no reason. I‚Äôm not unique. Look through the reviews.

I‚Äôve had this account for a couple years now. Use it on and off.

I live in an area where not many people use this app. Most of the profiles that come up are fake, porn bots, escorts, advertising for ig or Snapchat profiles. Every now and then, I match with real person, but not too often.

This afternoon 2/12/21 I opened the app up and found my account was banned. No email, no message, no notification as to why, just banned for ‚Äúactivity that violates terms of service‚Äù. I use the app what it‚Äôs intended for, no more no less. Being banned is amusing considering I sometimes don‚Äôt open the app for a week+ at a time. If the ban is a result of people I match with, remembering that most profiles I see are fake, me and my account are not the problem, the app and how they don‚Äôt ensure the vetting process in order to get an account is. If making a fake account or a bot account is so easy, instead of blocking legitimate users, how about added security to make sure they make it much more difficult to create bot/fake accounts.

Over all, I‚Äôm glad. I‚Äôm glad I can just uninstall this app since it‚Äôs more of a waste of time than anything else. Save yourself the frustration and uninstall or better yet, if you‚Äôre trying to decide whether or not to try this app- DONT. Download Hinge or an alternative to this trash.

Rated the app 1/5 stars. Doesn‚Äôt deserve the 1 star rating. Doesn‚Äôt deserve to be on iTunes."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I usually don‚Äôt make reviews buuutttttt as I see/read that other people have had bad experience with the app as well, I just thought to might as well write it since it‚Äôs happening soooooo often!!! 
I got tinder on Feb. 5th! I barely used it the first days but last night I got into it more because I decided to pay a subscription on the app to be able to see who‚Äôs liked me! In my own opinion I don‚Äôt recall having/saying something wrong with my profile! As a matter of fact, I didn‚Äôt have the chance to talk to ANYBODY ON THE APP!!! I go on the app this morning I was on it for about a minute and then all of a sudden it shut me out and said ‚ÄúYour account has been banned for activity that violates our terms of use‚Äù. I emailed them (which was hard to find the emailing request to possibly appeal) I explained the situation and I told them that I‚Äôd like to specifically know what I violated in the terms of use because I‚Äôve never had this issue in the past using other dating apps and tinder themselves years back! I got an email back that was basically repeating the same thing that it‚Äôs banned because I violated the terms of use OR the community guidelines, they take this seriously so my account will remain banned and so on. I email back again saying ‚Äúokay but please tell me what part of it did I violate in the terms of use or community guidelines, you guys aren‚Äôt specifying exactly what I did wrong. & I would just like to know‚Äù. Then I got an email back saying ‚Äúunfortunately, we cannot provide anymore detailed information at this time‚Äù. So then I received the email to leave them a review and I told them that I have a right to know why I‚Äôm being banned and that it‚Äôs not fair that they aren‚Äôt elaborating on what I did wrong. & also the fact that they aren‚Äôt doing appeals? Why not? I‚Äôm sure they aren‚Äôt that busy to reconsider appealing some people‚Äôs profiles. I really thought for a second that I was the only one but when I came back on the App Store to read the reviews I see that I‚Äôm not the only one. ü•≤üòå Like I said I‚Äôve never had any issues with any other dating apps so I guess I‚Äôll be taking my money elsewhere, read the reviews they are VERY TRUE!!!!!"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"For the last few weeks the app has been super glitchy, takes forever to load into a convo, once it does good forbid you want to type anything, as it delays super bad and misses words. Then I guess my profile disappeared from a bunch of matches and they can‚Äôt see our chat history, but I can?! What is up with that?"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"If you deactivate your account there‚Äôs a huge chance you get banned. Short of buying a new phone you can‚Äôt get unbanned lol. Their ‚Äúsupport‚Äù is a robot that sends an automated message, and im assuming it‚Äôs a robot / algorithm that bans you as well."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Can‚Äôt make changes and no way to overide
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Today 2/12/21 I randomly decided to go onto my tinder account to see if I have any messages and come to see that I have been banned with no reason or explanation. I rarely get on tinder so I am confused as to why I was banned. Also its really annoying to have advertisements popping up every couple of swipes. And also the constant pop-ups trying to get you to purchase memberships. I would like to know the reasoning for me being banned.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Your app crashes way to much to pay all this money for premium!
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,It would be really nice if we actually got to see who likes you instead of having to pay. If you ask me I think it‚Äôs kind of ridiculous that you have to pay to see who likes you. If the app was free why can‚Äôt seeing who likes you be free as well? I‚Äôm very disappointed.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Every time I go on the app and use it, I immediately get subscriptions to upgrade, which is fine in theory, but every time?? Really?? It‚Äôs super annoying, and the other apps don‚Äôt shove it down your throat like this one does"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,This app is trash! Paid for the gold I wasn‚Äôt even getting likes from ugly girls! I felt like my profile wasn‚Äôt seen by anyone! The more you pay on this app the less you get. Many scammers are on here just waiting to get fish decent people. I can‚Äôt stand tinder.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Ok I love the app but ur scammy bull crap with taking away all my super likes as soon as I end my membership I mean that‚Äôs petty and there is like 80% fake profiles boost needs to be a daily thing you guys need to be more like hilly tbh I paid for premium over there even when I lost my membership I kept some of my benigits you guys are basically robbing people blind so yea I‚Äôm gonna submit your app for review for scamming and I see that your code is linked to some of the scammers on this app aka fake profiles asking for money
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Literally only thing I see now n days is a person trying to sell onlyfans and drugs
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Don‚Äôt use this app, they‚Äôll ban your account for literally no reason and then basically tell you too bad, so sad because you can‚Äôt appeal it. I had my account for 1 day and hadn‚Äôt even matched or talked to anyone yet, got verified, and then they banned me. Customer Service is useless and just sends you copy and pasted email responses. There‚Äôs better apps out there, don‚Äôt waste your time."
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,The app just bans you with no warning or hope of ever getting back on the app. Usually no actual reason for the ban
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"I thought the bugs that this app has, will be removed so of course I updated it. And now if I write more than 3 sentences my phone gets so hot I'm afraid the battery will explode. You call this an update? Oh and it's still full of bugs. I'd rather have it as it was before, full of bugs but at least my phone wasn't melting in my hands."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I‚Äôve never used it, got banned"
tinder,us,12.1.0,5,Good app but my tuner keeps freezing and being really slow
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,"This app is just getting slower and slower, please fix this"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I hadn‚Äôt even messaged anyone yet, only swiped and they permanently banned my profile. I didn‚Äôt break any of the guidelines and when I emailed support about it, they basically said yes I did but didn‚Äôt tell me what I did wrong. Now I can‚Äôt get another account without a new phone number"
tinder,us,12.1.0,5,My tinder doesn‚Äôt show my new message if I want to see new messages I should delete it and download again!!
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I was not at all happy with the app at all even after making a purchase for a month still it didn‚Äôt allow me to customize my preferences enough. Just not a lot of options :(.
tinder,us,12.1.0,4,"PLEASE stop showing straight girls to those of us who are NOT straight because it‚Äôs aggravating. If a female doesn‚Äôt have that they are interested in both men and women or just women, then DON‚ÄôT show them as potential matches."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I paid for the Gold membership and after 6 months I moved from the US to Japan and BOOM I‚Äôm no longer verified and can‚Äôt chat with any matches, which defeats having the app at all. Naturally I‚Äôve sent in complaints and whenever they DO respond it‚Äôs a form-letter reply showing that they don‚Äôt read the details of your complaints at all. And don‚Äôt bother asking to speak with a supervisor because they‚Äôll never let you, even when they say they will. This was the worst purchase I‚Äôve ever made and I will never give these people money again."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"The app stopped loading, so I can‚Äôt even open it now. When it was working, the photos never loaded. We shouldn‚Äôt have to redownload the app every time it stops working. This app is so EXTRA with all the unnecessary ‚Äúbells and whistles‚Äù. Just show me a profile and let me swipe already! Fix your app! #mostuselessdatingappever-EVAR"

tinder,us,12.1.0,2,Tinder is just super buggy now. Also nobody cares about mystery matches such a dumb idea
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I was banned for reasons that were not told to me immediately after I purchased premium. This is how tinder makes a ton of money while keeping these ‚Äúpremium‚Äù amount of profiles low so that you always buy it
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"The app is good and design is well done, but the spam and fake count is high and ultimately drove me off and made me regret any subscription. If they can do something to get rid of the spam/fakes to connect real people with real people then it would grow in popularity again."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Just tired of all the bots. Same bots over and over again. If it‚Äôs not the bots it‚Äôs the buy my premium Snapchat. If it‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs the subscribe to my onlyfans. Really annoyed with this app.
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"Every time I get a message I have to delete the app and redownload it in order to read my messages. I get notifications for them, but they do not show up in my chats. Also my keyboard lags a lot when I use tinder."

tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Seriously. Most people are here for the eye candy. But that‚Äôs not the app‚Äôs problem. The app‚Äôs problem is the fake accounts, banning of real accounts for no reason, adds and promo‚Äôs for tinder up the bum. Don‚Äôt waste your time."

They see it as wrong when nothing should be seen wrong with people‚Äôs choices. Tinder is a disappointing app. They let people put noooodes in their pictures without banning them. My photos were very appropriate not against guide lines and I still wake up banned. Do not waste your time on this app."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Bots and women with 0 personalities that only promote their OF and IG. Don‚Äôt waste your time. Been on & off this app for years.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"*****THIS APP SHOULD NOT BE AN EDITORS CHOICE*******

Banned for absolutely no reason. I‚Äôm not unique. Look through the reviews.

I‚Äôve had this account for a couple years now. Use it on and off.

I live in an area where not many people use this app. Most of the profiles that come up are fake, porn bots, escorts, advertising for ig or Snapchat profiles. Every now and then, I match with real person, but not too often.

This afternoon 2/12/21 I opened the app up and found my account was banned. No email, no message, no notification as to why, just banned for ‚Äúactivity that violates terms of service‚Äù. I use the app what it‚Äôs intended for, no more no less. Being banned is amusing considering I sometimes don‚Äôt open the app for a week+ at a time. If the ban is a result of people I match with, remembering that most profiles I see are fake, me and my account are not the problem, the app and how they don‚Äôt ensure the vetting process in order to get an account is. If making a fake account or a bot account is so easy, instead of blocking legitimate users, how about added security to make sure they make it much more difficult to create bot/fake accounts.

Over all, I‚Äôm glad. I‚Äôm glad I can just uninstall this app since it‚Äôs more of a waste of time than anything else. Save yourself the frustration and uninstall or better yet, if you‚Äôre trying to decide whether or not to try this app- DONT. Download Hinge or an alternative to this trash.

Rated the app 1/5 stars. Doesn‚Äôt deserve the 1 star rating. Doesn‚Äôt deserve to be on iTunes."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I usually don‚Äôt make reviews buuutttttt as I see/read that other people have had bad experience with the app as well, I just thought to might as well write it since it‚Äôs happening soooooo often!!! 
I got tinder on Feb. 5th! I barely used it the first days but last night I got into it more because I decided to pay a subscription on the app to be able to see who‚Äôs liked me! In my own opinion I don‚Äôt recall having/saying something wrong with my profile! As a matter of fact, I didn‚Äôt have the chance to talk to ANYBODY ON THE APP!!! I go on the app this morning I was on it for about a minute and then all of a sudden it shut me out and said ‚ÄúYour account has been banned for activity that violates our terms of use‚Äù. I emailed them (which was hard to find the emailing request to possibly appeal) I explained the situation and I told them that I‚Äôd like to specifically know what I violated in the terms of use because I‚Äôve never had this issue in the past using other dating apps and tinder themselves years back! I got an email back that was basically repeating the same thing that it‚Äôs banned because I violated the terms of use OR the community guidelines, they take this seriously so my account will remain banned and so on. I email back again saying ‚Äúokay but please tell me what part of it did I violate in the terms of use or community guidelines, you guys aren‚Äôt specifying exactly what I did wrong. & I would just like to know‚Äù. Then I got an email back saying ‚Äúunfortunately, we cannot provide anymore detailed information at this time‚Äù. So then I received the email to leave them a review and I told them that I have a right to know why I‚Äôm being banned and that it‚Äôs not fair that they aren‚Äôt elaborating on what I did wrong. & also the fact that they aren‚Äôt doing appeals? Why not? I‚Äôm sure they aren‚Äôt that busy to reconsider appealing some people‚Äôs profiles. I really thought for a second that I was the only one but when I came back on the App Store to read the reviews I see that I‚Äôm not the only one. ü•≤üòå Like I said I‚Äôve never had any issues with any other dating apps so I guess I‚Äôll be taking my money elsewhere, read the reviews they are VERY TRUE!!!!!"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"For the last few weeks the app has been super glitchy, takes forever to load into a convo, once it does good forbid you want to type anything, as it delays super bad and misses words. Then I guess my profile disappeared from a bunch of matches and they can‚Äôt see our chat history, but I can?! What is up with that?"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"If you deactivate your account there‚Äôs a huge chance you get banned. Short of buying a new phone you can‚Äôt get unbanned lol. Their ‚Äúsupport‚Äù is a robot that sends an automated message, and im assuming it‚Äôs a robot / algorithm that bans you as well."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Can‚Äôt make changes and no way to overide
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Today 2/12/21 I randomly decided to go onto my tinder account to see if I have any messages and come to see that I have been banned with no reason or explanation. I rarely get on tinder so I am confused as to why I was banned. Also its really annoying to have advertisements popping up every couple of swipes. And also the constant pop-ups trying to get you to purchase memberships. I would like to know the reasoning for me being banned.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Your app crashes way to much to pay all this money for premium!
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,It would be really nice if we actually got to see who likes you instead of having to pay. If you ask me I think it‚Äôs kind of ridiculous that you have to pay to see who likes you. If the app was free why can‚Äôt seeing who likes you be free as well? I‚Äôm very disappointed.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Every time I go on the app and use it, I immediately get subscriptions to upgrade, which is fine in theory, but every time?? Really?? It‚Äôs super annoying, and the other apps don‚Äôt shove it down your throat like this one does"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,This app is trash! Paid for the gold I wasn‚Äôt even getting likes from ugly girls! I felt like my profile wasn‚Äôt seen by anyone! The more you pay on this app the less you get. Many scammers are on here just waiting to get fish decent people. I can‚Äôt stand tinder.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Ok I love the app but ur scammy bull crap with taking away all my super likes as soon as I end my membership I mean that‚Äôs petty and there is like 80% fake profiles boost needs to be a daily thing you guys need to be more like hilly tbh I paid for premium over there even when I lost my membership I kept some of my benigits you guys are basically robbing people blind so yea I‚Äôm gonna submit your app for review for scamming and I see that your code is linked to some of the scammers on this app aka fake profiles asking for money
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Literally only thing I see now n days is a person trying to sell onlyfans and drugs
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Don‚Äôt use this app, they‚Äôll ban your account for literally no reason and then basically tell you too bad, so sad because you can‚Äôt appeal it. I had my account for 1 day and hadn‚Äôt even matched or talked to anyone yet, got verified, and then they banned me. Customer Service is useless and just sends you copy and pasted email responses. There‚Äôs better apps out there, don‚Äôt waste your time."
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,The app just bans you with no warning or hope of ever getting back on the app. Usually no actual reason for the ban
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"I thought the bugs that this app has, will be removed so of course I updated it. And now if I write more than 3 sentences my phone gets so hot I'm afraid the battery will explode. You call this an update? Oh and it's still full of bugs. I'd rather have it as it was before, full of bugs but at least my phone wasn't melting in my hands."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I‚Äôve never used it, got banned"
tinder,us,12.1.0,5,Good app but my tuner keeps freezing and being really slow
tinder,us,12.1.0,3,"This app is just getting slower and slower, please fix this"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I hadn‚Äôt even messaged anyone yet, only swiped and they permanently banned my profile. I didn‚Äôt break any of the guidelines and when I emailed support about it, they basically said yes I did but didn‚Äôt tell me what I did wrong. Now I can‚Äôt get another account without a new phone number"
tinder,us,12.1.0,5,My tinder doesn‚Äôt show my new message if I want to see new messages I should delete it and download again!!
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I was not at all happy with the app at all even after making a purchase for a month still it didn‚Äôt allow me to customize my preferences enough. Just not a lot of options :(.
tinder,us,12.1.0,4,"PLEASE stop showing straight girls to those of us who are NOT straight because it‚Äôs aggravating. If a female doesn‚Äôt have that they are interested in both men and women or just women, then DON‚ÄôT show them as potential matches."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I paid for the Gold membership and after 6 months I moved from the US to Japan and BOOM I‚Äôm no longer verified and can‚Äôt chat with any matches, which defeats having the app at all. Naturally I‚Äôve sent in complaints and whenever they DO respond it‚Äôs a form-letter reply showing that they don‚Äôt read the details of your complaints at all. And don‚Äôt bother asking to speak with a supervisor because they‚Äôll never let you, even when they say they will. This was the worst purchase I‚Äôve ever made and I will never give these people money again."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"The app stopped loading, so I can‚Äôt even open it now. When it was working, the photos never loaded. We shouldn‚Äôt have to redownload the app every time it stops working. This app is so EXTRA with all the unnecessary ‚Äúbells and whistles‚Äù. Just show me a profile and let me swipe already! Fix your app! #mostuselessdatingappever-EVAR"
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"I‚Äôve been trying to join Tinder, but it keeps saying......üëâüèº There was a network connectivity issue. Please try again later."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Melting pot of degenerates.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I got band for no reason and now I‚Äôm never allowed on? This app is stupid and I want my money back!
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,Tinder is just super buggy now. Also nobody cares about mystery matches such a dumb idea
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,I was banned for reasons that were not told to me immediately after I purchased premium. This is how tinder makes a ton of money while keeping these ‚Äúpremium‚Äù amount of profiles low so that you always buy it
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"The app is good and design is well done, but the spam and fake count is high and ultimately drove me off and made me regret any subscription. If they can do something to get rid of the spam/fakes to connect real people with real people then it would grow in popularity again."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Just tired of all the bots. Same bots over and over again. If it‚Äôs not the bots it‚Äôs the buy my premium Snapchat. If it‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs the subscribe to my onlyfans. Really annoyed with this app.
tinder,us,12.1.0,2,"Every time I get a message I have to delete the app and redownload it in order to read my messages. I get notifications for them, but they do not show up in my chats. Also my keyboard lags a lot when I use tinder."
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,Don‚Äôt like that you have to have a phone number to creat an account.
tinder,us,12.1.0,1,"Seriously. Most people are here for the eye candy. But that‚Äôs not the app‚Äôs problem. The app‚Äôs problem is the fake accounts, banning of real accounts for no reason, adds and promo‚Äôs for tinder up the bum. Don‚Äôt waste your time."
tinder,ca,12.2.0,1,had way better luck on bumble
tinder,ca,12.2.0,1,"This app used to be good when it first came out and I'd get a few matches a day at least. Now? I've been on for over a month and I haven't matched with a single person. If you're a boy, just steer clear they only let you match with ppl after you pay money"
tinder,ca,12.2.0,1,I have canceled this subscription many times but they charge every month from my card and when i try to call them there is no customer support number it is disgusting üëéüèø
tinder,ca,12.2.0,1,Spoke among a lot of people I know and everyone agrees that it‚Äôs not as likely to get matches. Not going to be using it for much longer if that consists.
tinder,ca,12.2.0,5,Nice hahshsa d dbdbsbjs a
tinder,ca,12.2.0,1,I was banned for having BLM in my bio and they ignore my emails. Horrible app.
tinder,ca,12.2.0,5,I met the love of my life
tinder,ca,12.2.0,1,"Waste of time, matches don‚Äôt appear once you hit your ‚Äúlimit‚Äù just a money grab to try to get you to pay"
tinder,ca,12.2.0,1,This app is horrible.. I‚Äôm newly single out of a 4 year relationship and I‚Äôm 20 years old. I had tinder for a week and was very kinda to people didn‚Äôt have any bad pictures on there of me and got banned for no reason... I emailed the company and they basically told me to F off so thanks for nothing tinder worst app ever
tinder,ca,12.2.0,5,Tinder is a great app  to use for finding your true soulmate
tinder,ca,12.2.0,1,I buy lots of super likes. You match with someone then you get a spam webpage link and then the user is gone. Also have matched with women and they disappear before you message them. Something is fishy going on with tinder. Seems like they are creating fake profiles to lure people in.  They won‚Äôt give you super likes back and they know there‚Äôs tons of fake profiles. Bumble and Hinge are much better.
tinder,ca,12.2.0,1,Matches keep disappearing and reappearing with the whole convo being deleted
tinder,ca,12.2.0,1,"I can go through a week without finding anyone.  You expect me to pay $22.99/month to search for nobody in my area?  $5/mon maybe reasonable.

Also it notifies you that someone has liked you.  You can receive search from someone 9000km away.   Not paying a membership fee to be notified someone liked you from the other side of the world."
tinder,ca,12.2.0,1,"Banned for no reason, several of my friends are banned for no reason. I had the same profile, photos and description for at least a year. I had a tinder gold subscription at one point and no issues. One day I go to log in and I discover I‚Äôve been banned. I try to contact customer support after re-reading their policies and community guidelines and made no transgressions against any policy or guideline. No racism, no bullying, no lewd photos, no harassment. In their guidelines it states that there is no formal appeals process, however under exceptional circumstances they will lift a ban. 

When I reached out to them for clarification or justification of their actions, I received a reply from Kelly (the name of their auto reply computer apparently) stating they won‚Äôt lift the ban.

When I replied to that email, asking for further clarification and citing the policy where they state they will review certain exceptional cases, I received the same cookie cutter email as the first response. 

I replied to that email as well, and ‚ÄúKelly‚Äù sent me the exact same email for the third time in a row. 

Conclusion: this is now is all about generating profit. There is no customer support. The developers are extremely arbitrary. Why would you use this app and invest time and potentially money building your profile and meeting people, only to have that unjustly taken from you, and you will loose all your contacts, their names, information, and conversations. 

If you read the small print, this app is now all about profiting from you and exploiting you. They take your phone number and sell it to solicitors. Your photos, likeness, etc.  (which once you upload become their property, and can advertise with your content, royalty free). They track your information. Do not use this app. Use an alternative that has decent customer satisfaction."
tinder,ca,12.2.0,2,"Garbage app. I know they‚Äôre making vast profits so why does it crash every 5 minutes? As well, why is the compression such a joke? You could upload the highest quality image and the app still makes it incredibly blurry."
tinder,ca,12.2.0,1,"Downloaded the app, put in my phone number and got the verification code, put that in and before I even really made an account it says I'm banned. I know my number was a used number but there's got to be a way to fix this."
tinder,ca,12.2.0,4,every so often i‚Äôll see people that don‚Äôt match the age range or location i‚Äôve set. i‚Äôve logged out and deleted and reinstalled the app and nothing will change. how can i fix it.
tinder,ca,12.2.0,1,"Age Restricted for no fkn reason

I‚Äôm 18 and can‚Äôt login to my account cuz it says age restricted ‚ÄúwE dEtEcTeD tHaT yOu MaY nOt MeEt ThE aGe ReStRiCtIoNs...‚Äù and there is no way to communicate with a person from Tinder to fix this they basically sent me an email saying go f yourself we don‚Äôt care"
tinder,ca,12.2.0,1,"This app makes me want to tear my hair out. You charge this much for gold and likes screen is slow, glitchy and basically unusable? Nice"
tinder,ca,12.2.0,1,Blocked me for no reason. Tried contacting them so many times but no response.
tinder,ca,12.2.0,1,"i proudly hand you this 1-star review for the great disservice to communities around the world and unstoppable greed (you guys did not even care about sacrificing the remains of this app‚Äôs usability, that is how ridiculously greedy you are)."
tinder,ca,12.2.0,1,"Literally everyday the ‚ÄúTop Picks‚Äù will be filled with caucasians and then a token POC. Tinder has a race problem, caucasian profiles will show up on the swipe deck more often compared to POC. Even though I live in an area with predominantly more POC they tend to only show up every 10+ swipes later."
tinder,ca,12.2.0,1,"This app is so glitchy and slow is practically unusable. Just using it takes forever, no other apps on my phone stutter like this it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm on an iPhone 4. Hinge doesn‚Äôt have issues working, neither does bumble"
tinder,ca,12.2.0,1,"You should start to verify your users. I just being fraud and there's nothing i can do.
The guy on the pictures is not Tinder. I found him somewhere else. And TikTok had a lot of others users who said the same thing. They said that you don't care! 
Listen to us now!"
tinder,ca,12.2.0,1,"I can guarantee that it will either stop me from typing or get stuck trying to read a message, every next message. 
I hope they figure it out. I don't like to use it any longer."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,just my luck is that star to rate. I dont have any luck with the ladies on here. That review has nothing to do with tinder just a personal rate on myself
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,It sucks to see the girl i was talkin to vanish
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,Tinder works horrible on my iPhone 12 Pro Max. It wouldn‚Äôt allow me go to the next page at times until I force shut the app and open again.
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"The app banned me for absolutely no reason. If I ever wish to use  it I will have to get a new phone and SIM card. As a gay man  there are very limited spaces to me and chat with gay man in a safe space. I feel as if, since the app has the monopoly of being the biggest dating app, they should at least have an appeal process for getting unbanned."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,2,"app has been almost unusable since the previous update. very slow/laggy, matches take like 15s to load before you can keep swiping, hopping between menus is brutal. really needs a fix"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"watch out they will create a paid account even if you dont allow it then no refunds. scammers, beware of tinder"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"Matched with one girl din‚Äôt demean her in anyway rather she abused me and by the time was about to answer got unmatched n found myself banned next day . 
So basically even if one chick reports instant ban such biasing towards girls"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,This app is unbelievably slow lately.. it won‚Äôt let me swipe left for around 15 seconds between each picture. Also the messages keep moving around/are out of order. It‚Äôs impossible to do anything..
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"All tinder premium options are garbage. I wasted my money. No likes, no matches, and the boost me is a joke. Also please remove inactive accounts. And wth is with the insta plug. So dissatisfied and disappointed. I WANT MY MONEY BACK."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"I was on tinder for several months and was banned out of the blue, not for violating policy, but because I was reported for rejecting men who harassed me and cat fished me. If I defended myself against harassment or rejected advances, men would report me, if I called out someone for cat fishing I would get reported. It‚Äôs so easy to report people and if you get reported enough your account banned and tinder will not look into the reports, it‚Äôs just done automatically. I wrote to tinder and I got the same email every time saying ‚Äútinder takes violations seriously‚Äù but they don‚Äôt take violations seriously enough to look into them üòÇ."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,2,"J ai fais un teste j aimer tous les femmes en bas de 30 ans et  plus de 90% qui ont r√©pondu √† mon j aime c √©tais pour vendre des vid√©o et et le reste en montant 50% encore d√®s demandes d argent donc d√©penser pas votre argent sur ce site 

Merci √† vous"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"That‚Äôs kind of intense to be banned forever you should change or atleast give a warning when someone might have cross the terms and conditions because we all know not all of us read them. And let people be able to appeal when they do get banned. Tinder is a good way to to talk to people during this time we are rn, I hope this changes."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,I feel I‚Äôm a decent looking dude that women would be attracted to.  In 3 weeks I have had 5 or 6 likes and 1 match that ghosted for no reason. Dating apps don‚Äôt make money making matches... think about it.
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,Matches disappear then a few months later they re appear showing you matched with them x amount of weeks or months ago. Chat log also disappears. Potentially destroying the opportunity to meet someone
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,Banned without any reason. Didnt do anything and have been on the app for a long time. Really dissapointed.
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"Absolute garbage app if you‚Äôre a guy and don‚Äôt pay; you won‚Äôt show up much on others swipes, you also have to pay more than women do. Basically women control the whole app since they get over 1k likes a day while men would struggle to get a few likes a week..."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,Deleted my matches after spending money on this app. I‚Äôm done. Don‚Äôt waste your money or time.
tinder,ca,12.1.0,4,So the app info says that this app is 17+ app. I‚Äôm 17. When I logged in it said you need to be 18+. What the heck? Ugh now I have to wait 100 days üòÇ but like why do that? It is so frustrating. Just type 18+ app not 17+ misleading...
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,I searched for free dating sites but I can‚Äôt afford these ridiculous  prices the pics are often of a forest boat launch or if you do get a real photo it‚Äôs some old guy asleep in a chair PLUS There is NO way to get a hold of any worker‚Äôs at tinder to ask questions also I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs the woman‚Äôs job to chase the male!! Therefore women  should be free and omg that would bring the men running there is no way to remove your own profile
tinder,ca,12.1.0,2,"lots of glitching screens and crashing it‚Äôs so annoying lol
i also suggest a dark mode:( like really suggest"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,üëéüèª
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,Tinder was always a slow app compared to others on my iPhone XSM but this week has become super slow and unresponsive. No amount of tapping would make it budge.
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"Crash report:
Opening app. Doesn‚Äôt pass the tinder red load screen 

Swipe to leave conversation causes black screen with keyboard. 
Freeze after swiping for some time."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,2,"I used to love tinder and use it all the time, but for some reason I went to log in one day and I was banned? I have no clue why, but I‚Äôm really annoyed about it. Tinder, what‚Äôs up?!??"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,Keeps saying I‚Äôm in Toronto and won‚Äôt change it let me and customer support didn‚Äôt respond once
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,Stop sending me notifications for no reason at all. If I don‚Äôt have a message or a match I don‚Äôt need a notification. So irritating it makes me want to delete the app
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"Started to create a profile, door rang for Amazon delivery. Came back, kid entered it‚Äôs birthday as my age, now can‚Äôt use app even if i delete and reinstall. Well, screw you Tinder"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,No matches
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,Went to go log into my account one day to see that it had been banned. I have no idea why and why I contacted support they wouldn‚Äôt help or even tell me why! So disappointing..
tinder,ca,12.1.0,2,"My software and app are up to date, I‚Äôve deleted and re downloaded the app, I‚Äôve logged out and back in and nothing seems to make it work."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,My card was charged $20.50 for one month but said ‚Äúpayment failed‚Äù and charged me anyway. Will change review when it‚Äôs fixed.

tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"this app needs work, you want people to pay so much to have more control yet i keep getting the same people over and over again?? this is irritating and not worth it. fix this!"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,Got banned for absolutely no reason? And now can‚Äôt get back on or make a new account literally did nothing wrong and don‚Äôt understand why I have been banned very frustrated! Even tinder doesn‚Äôt want me to find someone üò°üò°üò°
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,I put my distance at 50 Km and I get matched with women 130+ km away and everywhere in between.  It also matches across the Canada/ US border.  If you want to avoid that nuisance get Bumble.
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"My account was banned, I didn‚Äôt violate any of the terms or guidelines. Customer service is very poor, they won‚Äôt even tell me why or provide any support to fix it."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"I deleted (not suspended, but DELETED) my account 2 weeks ago. Got a bill today for an account that doesn‚Äôt exist!! 

They apparently didn‚Äôt understand that when I closed the account I also wanted to stop paying the bill..."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,2,"So you got a nonbinary gender option, can we just straight up add a nonbinary search or preference option? 

So many people would love to use that, as a queer person picking nonbinary and then choosing whether people find me as a man or woman just defeats the whole purpose of that option. Then I‚Äôm stuck explaining myself to every match or feeling like half of the people don‚Äôt actually want to date someone like myself. As a very ambiguous person."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,I love using tinder but since the last couple days it has been soo laggy and slow. Please fix this
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"I was flagged for being a bot which I am not. Then was asked to solve a puzzle. I  have dyscalculia.

Hello,

Thanks for writing in. If you are seeing this error message, it means your account has been banned from Tinder for violating our Terms of Use or Community Guidelines"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,This app just seems like a big money grab. A lot of the profiles seem fake
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,You should let people use text now to sign up it‚Äôs dating app let ppl enjoy it stop blocking people for no reason and other apps are beating tinder now soon you going to lose and I‚Äôm going to tell everyone to write bad review here this is horrible
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,I downloaded the app and paid $53 for platinum and was instantly shadowbanned.  No reason given. All my pics are real.  Feels like theft if no refund is provided
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,Ayoooo where are all the cute boys???
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,Easily the worst dating app if you happen to live in a border city then tinder will be broken. I live in Canada and more than 90% of the card deck I‚Äôm shown is all Americans which I immediately swipe left app is basically unusable I can be at it for 30 minutes and see maybe 2 people from Canada. Bumble runs circles around tinder I have never had this issue on there in fact the opposite. Unusable garbage and a huge waste of time.
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"Somehow I‚Äôve been locked out of my account which I signed up with using my phone number and none of my 3 possible backup emails are working to get me back in. They said they will escalate the issue and never got back to me even after several follow up emails. All I want to do is delete my profile for good so it‚Äôs not just floating out there. The app is unsafe and Tinder doesn‚Äôt care about you not being able to access your own information. There are better working apps out there that respect the privacy of your data, do yourself a favour and forget and boycott this garbage app."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"banned for no reason, please fix this"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,3,"Seeing peoples updated pictures and bios was the only way I could easily navigate my matches because let‚Äôs be honest, we all let matches pile up sometimes. Matches are way too difficult to browse through now. PLEASE bring this feature back!! I‚Äôm begging you!! üò≠"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,5,I GOT TO MEET THE SWEETEST COOLEST FUNNIEST N CUTEST GUY EVER TYSM TINDER
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"Banned and no customer service to say why, 

This app is starting to tank itself"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,I was banned for no reason and their support team sucks
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,Can get past the verification puzzle every time I get it right it just loads and send me back to the verification puzzle
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,it says i‚Äôm not 18 and I am and it won‚Äôt let me verify my age
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"Over night, all of my matches were deleted. I was paying for the most expensive plan. Customer support was beyond useless, not even reading my simple messages and responding with completely unrelated canned messages repeatedly. 

A resolution was never offered, not even an apology (I understand bugs happen). They eventually just stopped responding."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,2,Would help if this app actually worked. I open it and all that happens is a white screenüò°üò°
tinder,ca,12.1.0,2,"Love using this app to meet new people but I have so many problems with the function and set up of the app. First I thought it was my wifi or phone itself and tried so many things and it‚Äôs only tinder that isn‚Äôt working. Messages won‚Äôt show up after I get the notification, the screen is EXTREMELY laggy and I can‚Äôt type a full sentence without it taking AT LEAST 5 minutes of glitching on the keyboard. I really enjoy the app but the overall function of the app really needs to be fixed, it‚Äôs getting so bad that most of the time I can no longer use it, just sits on my Home Screen untouched."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,The only way I see my new messages is when I delete and reinstall the app. Such a joke! Like some people don‚Äôt wanna give their person social media away just to talk to a dude.. it be nice if I got notified about all my messages and matches
tinder,ca,12.1.0,2,AS I SAID ON THE TITLE I HAVE NEVER BEEN CRUDE OR INAPPROPRIATE TO THESE WOMEN. IT SAID IN MY PROFILE THAT I AM NOT LOOKING FOR RELATIONSHIPS BUT HOOKUPS. THIS HAS CRUSHED ME. IF I KMS THIS IS ON YOU TINDER!!!!!!!!
tinder,ca,12.1.0,5,"I was definitely having so much more success matching when I had the normal version, it‚Äôs like the moment I updated to Gold  I stop matching and then it keeps pushing the idea of getting Tinder Plus with the idea of putting me in from of more people.. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
Not worth paying for Tinder Gold"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"Just gonna repost about how I paid for premium when I was 18, deleted my account for a bit, then signed up again and accidentally selected a year off for my age and got locked out till I turned 19. Like the better half of a year. I tried resolving the issue myself and contacted ‚Äú tinder support ‚Äú multiple times. No help
I was permanently locked out. 
No solutions found
No refund even. 
No one from support helped me. 
Tough luck they said
I made a post on Reddit and it got deleted pretty quick. 
Hm. Interesting. 
Probably won‚Äôt get help here either. 
My suggestion? Don‚Äôt bother with this app."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,Takes several seconds for anything you interact with on screen to respond. Even scrolling is difficult. The app is literally unusable.
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,99% of what‚Äôs Tinder is either bots or girls looking to advertise their social media accounts. There‚Äôs far better platforms for dating than this trash.
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"Let me start by saying I would give this zero stars if I could. I recently received a permanent ban from tinder, as to what the reason is I could not tell you. I‚Äôve only ever been respectful when having conversations and there wasn‚Äôt anything offensive on my bio whatsoever. I contacted tinders customer support to have my account removed from the ban list, however that did not occur, instead they told me how serious they take there ban reports. They completely neglected my appeal let alone even acknowledged it at all. I‚Äôve seen some pretty offensive stuff on many accounts that i can across, yet i get banned without any explanation. Tinder is a joke and so is there customer support. Don‚Äôt waste your time folks."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"This app is a hot dumpster fire. It‚Äôs full of escorts, prostitutes, and Instagram thotsShamelessly plugging their IG pages, and their Snapchat accounts.There is seemingly no effort put forward from the tinder ‚ÄúDevelopment crew‚Äù, to weed out fake profiles making this a frustrating experience of spam messages and dead profiles. I urge you to not pay money for this app as it is light years behind where it should be for something you would expect to pay for. ALSO,Stop asking me if I want to upgrade my likes. I gave the lake that I gave for a reason. I know how to upgrade them, and if I wanted to do that I would do it. DUMPSTER FIRE."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"Ok so to be honest this is getting unfair and totally bullcrap for us guys. Too many bots, damn models just promoting and just trolls left and right, I feel like tinder team doesn‚Äôt even care about the problems happening and probably won‚Äôt ever deal with it. And this is suppose to be one of the top dating apps?! I‚Äôm seriously preferring bumble over this slowly and slowly because my ‚ÄúMATCH‚Äù is always some damn model, bot, or someone asking for my credit information for their wEbCaMe, I‚Äôve also had friends who complain about the same thing like what is this, A DATING APP OR A ADVERTISEMENT APP? This goes nowhere but deeper and deeper into the abyss that to be honest, this app‚Äôs team should either DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT or might as well get rid of tinder and find a better damn way of getting *cough cough* a REAL match. This app doesn‚Äôt even verify you correctly, and should have a better system instead of letting this bullcrap slide behind your DAMN BACKS."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,2,I don‚Äôt know why I set my distance to 30km max and I only get suggestions from 60km+.     I live in a big city with tiny towns around.  Please advise?
tinder,ca,12.1.0,2,Need any women here. They can send me an email at Estrad1993@gmail given that I‚Äôve been about on tinder about 1.5y. No luck at all so far.
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"Literally was polite, never got political. And got banned for no reason at all. Horrible app. Should be embarrassed. What a joke. I payed too."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,i typed in my wrong bday. now the app doesnt let me fix that and its only showing me a date
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,My app crashed and now all my matches are gone
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,You seriously can‚Äôt have a dog alone in a photo. They won‚Äôt let me appeal this either.
tinder,ca,12.1.0,3,When I was making my profile I was picking out the things that are my hobbies and one of the hobbies I have is being a gamer and the problem here is I have noticed I am not finding anyone that has similar likes to mine I‚Äôve seen some similar ones but not gamer and I can imagine there‚Äôs a lot of other guys and girls that are gamers and might find this offensive in a way because gaming is a lot bigger than some people think but I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm not finding anyone it‚Äôs kind of making me a little disappointed but overall I‚Äôd say I like the app and I‚Äôll continue looking
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,for an app with a punishment system they should have some sort of appeals team. i did nothing wrong??? when i emailed they said ‚Äúwe have no ban appeals at this time??‚Äù WHAT the hell man.
tinder,ca,12.1.0,2,"I‚Äôve been using Tinder for about a couple of months now, and today for some reason when I opened the app it‚Äôs telling me that my accounts been banned. No specific reason. I haven‚Äôt done anything wrong or anything and don‚Äôt know why this happened"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"I re-downloaded tinder a couple weeks ago and it‚Äôs been so laggy, it take forever to respond to what I do on my screen ie; I‚Äôll type a sentence and it won‚Äôt show up that I typed it until like a minute after, and its rlly hard to swipe when it lags. I even have tinder gold and half my matches won‚Äôt load or if I try to swipe it‚Äôll say something along the lines of ‚Äúerror occurred, unable to match with ____‚Äù. I‚Äôve tried to delete and redownload the app multiple times and it‚Äôs still occurring. I can barely do anything on there, so I‚Äôve basically wasted money for tinder gold for nothing. üôÉ"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"After using it for a month, getting lots of local matches, suddenly all of the girls showing up  started looking like Instagram models, and i quit getting any matches. 
This app is definitely being manipulated to try and force you to make expensive in-app purchases. Stay away from this
Also, I start every message off with a GIF. The GIF‚Äôs are accessible because of the app creators. So if there are GIF‚Äôs that are offensive, they should not be allowed on. I was reported and banned from Tinder. The only message I had sent was a GIF. If I can be reported and banned for a GIF, then why was the GIF allowed by the app developer... don‚Äôt punish and ban users for using the GIF‚Äôs your own app developers gave us access to."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,2,"After a couple of swipes, the app becomes unresponsive. This only happens on this app. Hinge, bumble and others works perfectly. I have to keep killing the app every now and then. Please fix your memory leak!"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,I haven't even opened the app in days and I was banned.. I haven't done anything and I don't care to get my account back because after I paid for a membership it was too glitchy to use for over a week. Screw this app üòÇ
tinder,ca,12.1.0,3,The app ain‚Äôt bad but what‚Äôs the point of sending a superlike if the person receiving it can‚Äôt even look at it?
tinder,ca,12.1.0,2,I can‚Äôt even use this app anymore because it is so laggy. I can barely swipe and I can barely text people and my messages don‚Äôt even load
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"I got banned over a year ago for absolutely no reason, i legit used the app maybe once a week, got zero matches and then got banned. No explanation, i emailed them to ask, they said they can‚Äôt provide any information, and there‚Äôs no appeals. Fun app."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,Put my age in before I turned 18 and was waiting the week before my birthday for it to allow me to sign up and now it‚Äôs just counting backwards and not letting me sign up at all
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"Gross 

Chez"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,it says 17 and up and yet when you put in your birthday you get restricted
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"Just deleted the app, so laggy I‚Äôve never seen this before."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"I only downloaded the app so that I can let you know how annoying your YouTube ad campaign is. I use videos to help me fall asleep, and I do not appreciate being blasted with an annoying clapping chant. ‚ÄúSay it! Pick it! Get it!‚Äù 

Marketing companies use our psychology to get in our heads so that when we want something such as a dating app, Tinder is first to come to mind.

Guess what? I‚Äôm using that psychology against you and I‚Äôll never use your product. I don‚Äôt support companies that blast with me with intrusive and annoying ads. 

I will be uninstalling the app. If I could give you a zero star rating, I would. Goodbye."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"I‚Äôm one of the people banned for no reason along with no response, the amount of bots and nude profile pics on this app and I get banned?!?! Don‚Äôt wast your time, absolute joke."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,Full of fake profiles and always hounding you for money for credits. Save your money totally not worth what the rob you for
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"Tinder, why have a filter option when the filters don‚Äôt work?I set a filter in terms of age and location and yet I‚Äôm seeing users outside this filter. SMH"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,Using tinder will make you think only boujee barbie-like white women live in the GTA. This app is absolutely pathetic now. Just a scam
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"Hi!
Tinder is lagging, i get message notifications but no messages appears and I don‚Äôt have a single match since yesterday but I usually match with every guy I swipe rightüòÖ"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,I‚Äôm a lesbian and even though I have my preferences set to only women I still see a lot of men come up for some reason. Got a pop up today asking me to consent to new terms and conditions that would let them use my personal info and when I tried to look at the terms and conditions they weren‚Äôt even in English so what was that about
tinder,ca,12.1.0,2,"On Feb 4,2021 I opened the app and a ‚Äúmandatory terms‚Äù window popped up with different terms and conditions. One of the terms was that my personal info will be shared outside South Korea. When I clicked on details Cantonese showed up and the only language option were East Asian languages. My friend also saw the same issue. We assumed tinder had been hacked. We‚Äôve deleted the app. Hope this gets fixed ASAP. I got matches waiting üò¢"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"The new feature where it forces you to crop photos makes almost all photos unusable. Should include an option for photo cropping without making it THAT zoomed in? Terrible new feature. 

Also got banned for no reason at some point."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"Today many users opened the app with a prompt to agree to outrageous, privacy invading terms of service. Details of these terms were in a different language. Confusion abounds and many are now deleting the app, as they should"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"I will not consent to Facebook selling my information, unless they start to give me money from selling it."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"Needs better filters for spam accounts, needs a way to verify profiles. 
Bad algorithm overall, terrible for getting matches, unless you‚Äôre paying of course..
Won‚Äôt let me upload new photos
Way too many onlyfans accounts
And now every 2nd swipe it asks if you want to use a super like, so people pay even more.
This app needs a total damn overhaul, pretty terrible
And now the terms and conditions only show up in Korean with no way to change it. Not suspicious at all."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"Such a bad app,"
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"App wanted more consent approval, when I looked at the details the language switched from English to another, when I used google translate it mention saving credit card information (most concerning). My phone is programmed in English and Italian so why did the language switch to a completely random one."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"They want all your data to sell to third parties. 

I had a yearly sub. Paid in full. A few months in they change the terms and conditions and MANDATE that I agree to them selling my data to third parties plus track my location. I tapped the details of the new contract and it was all in some Asian language I can‚Äôt read or understand. 

How is that legal to mandate someone sign a contract and have it in a foreign language. 

F U tinder. I‚Äôm done."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,Terms and service and consent are all in Korean with no English option
tinder,ca,12.1.0,3,what's this nonsense about needing to update consent to 3rd party info sharing and use of my info outside korea that came out with the last update?
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"I was perfectly fine using this app. Got a few matches and was ok with the good, bad and the ugly parts of it. NEW UPDATE: now the developers are making it MADATORY for anyone who uses the app to allow them to use and share our personal info with whomever they choose. This is a dating app. I feel like you are now asking too much. Deleted and happy trails Tinder."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,All of a sudden tinder won‚Äôt let me access my account anymore with out having to agree to some let Korea access all my information mandatory and you try reading the info and it‚Äôs all in Korean
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,So many fake accounts and the new terms and conditions are insane. No thanks.
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,Banned me for a photo in a bikini that every other dating app has allowed. Ban so many people for dumb reasons.
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"Used App for a werk, paid premium subscription. Right after that Tinder blocked my assess to the app demanding ALL MY FACEBOOK PROFILE DATA to be shared with tinder. If you decide, you can‚Äôt use app. Ok. Ciao, morons."
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,so laggy it‚Äôs unusable
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,No help from support
tinder,ca,12.1.0,1,"Bought a 3 month subscription for Tinder gold then a couple of weeks later after not using the app for a while, I go on to see what‚Äôs new and I see I‚Äôve been banned. I go talk to support and they tell me that they can‚Äôt tell me why I‚Äôm banned and that I can‚Äôt dispute it. What type of rule is that?üòÇ Garbage app"
tinder,ca,,1,This app isn't useful for me. What I find annoying is how I cancelled this app and they still charge me monthly.. Stop charging me. I reported a problem and cancelled. Stop charging me and doing automatic renewals.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,2,Latest update has left the app with such a lag it‚Äôs barely functioning. Even the site is terrible. I just paid to upgrade and now I can‚Äôt even talk to my matches let alone get new ones!
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"As an Indian-Canadian male I have not been able to get a single match from anyone on this app, other than women of my own background or of Asian descent. Are White girls racist against Indian males? Yes. They. Are."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,Mon compte a √©t√© bannis pour aucune raison
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,deleted and reinstalled app but its still draining 20% of battery  per hour when not using it on iphone 12. phone says it‚Äôs playing ‚Äúmusic‚Äù in the background?
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"Banned for no reason, sexist app sucks"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,2,Tinder is so laggy these times. No fluidity in the chat. I need to restart the app every five minutes. Need an update
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"Unless you pay an arm and a leg, this site is hot garbage."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,2,"Got a ban from tinder today out of the blue. Can honestly say I didn‚Äôt post, say or do anything wrong. Set my account up properly & I'm guessing the only thing I could‚Äôve done better is verify my profile. Sad there‚Äôs no appeal process to get an account back."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"Ran into the issue of tinder randomly profiling my account and banning me for being ‚Äúunder aged‚Äù, even though i am 18. I understand they sometime randomly select accounts to verify their age but it took me to this random website off the application to verify my IDs, which I don‚Äôt feel safe giving my IDs away anywhere without verifying it‚Äôs the valid site. 

I tried contacting customer service both via email and phone call. The phone call got absolutely no where and the employee answering my email was no help at all. I just wanted a simple answer to verify the website was the correct site so I could verify my IDs and continue with my day but the customer service is absolutely poor and they sound like robots repeating themselves and ignoring my simple question."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,Tinder a banni mon compte avec aucune explication j‚Äôessaie de joindre le service √† la client√®le sans succ√®s j‚Äôaimerais avoir des explications!!!
tinder,ca,11.31.0,2,"This app is great if you‚Äôre looking for quantity of matches. The issue is:

1. Most people on this app are asking to add them on other social media apps like snap chat or ig which means 

2. This app either drains your battery or uses too much data or both 

3. I don‚Äôt need the app to increase my ranges when I run out of people. Am I really going to drive 100 km for a date ? No. 

4. Introduce sound on your app. Human connection is about multiple senses. 

5. I have no idea what this swipe surge is. 

6. When you roll out a new feature, wouldn‚Äôt it be great if you explained what the feature is ? Half the people are probably confused

7. Anywya thanks for connecting us to other people. Global was the best which doesn‚Äôt work now."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,3,"Every few weeks, without my doing, tinder will delete all my matches??? So I start at 0 every few weeks which is annoying when I‚Äôm talking to someone cool and haven‚Äôt exchanged info yet"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,This app absolutely sucks I didn‚Äôt didn‚Äôt do anything to violate any of the guidelines I woke up in the morning and my account was banned for no reason!!! Very frustrating
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"Every time I use tinder and adjust the settings to stay within an age and distance it never stays within those. For example, I‚Äôll set my distance to 40km and it will show me SEVERAL upwards of 120km. That‚Äôs not close and it‚Äôs not only a couple, it‚Äôs a lot. For people who don‚Äôt want long distance, this is is very frustrating."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,I have had tinder for only 2 weeks and I have already been banned with no explanation and no way to get my account back it is ridiculous how they just ban people for no reason.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,They give you a lot of matches on the first day to get you hooked and then take it all away. I got 15 matches on my first day and then 1 a day after that. They want you to purchase their premium garbage. Never seen this much greed. Hopefully another dating app comes along the way.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,2,Why can‚Äôt you use email?
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"i got tinder when i turned 18, and they banned my account!!! it didn‚Äôt even give me an option to submit photos of my ID."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"I use this app for a bit and found some success, but later was banned and wasn‚Äôt given a reason. I emailed their support and got an automated email saying they don‚Äôt appeal bans. I never actually did anything i could recall that i could even get banned for and it won‚Äôt let me make another account"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,5,"Sorry quick question I‚Äôm just trying to find out how to remove my tinder gold prior to the recurring billing charges , could someone help me ASAP thank you ."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,When you ban people you should at least (like Facebook) give them the reason why they get banned. Read the comments of your users. People are getting banned without knowing what happened. Terrible app. Mediocre developers. Did they learn to code this from YouTube? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"I have deleted & reinstalled the app twice, the account I made still won‚Äôt delete. You can pause your account just fine, but I want to delete my account and it comes up with a message that suggests they‚Äôre having problems deleting my account & to try again later. I‚Äôve tried many times now and this is driving me crazy. Please fix."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,The only dating app I‚Äôve ever used where I contact customer support for help and they do not get back to you. I do not recommend this app.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"Got banned for absolutely nothing, no appeal process.  Emailed them and they said they couldn‚Äôt do anything and sent me the community guidelines and terms of service.  
WHAT A JOKE"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"I been using this app for 2 years now, I'm 21 years old , and out of sudden they just asking me for my Passport picture, what's next think this app need? My address and CVV number? Vey dissapoining"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"These tiny d!cked pr!cks banned me before I ever even had an account. I tried to sign up and it showed ‚Äúbanned‚Äù the second I entered my number. I tried to contact tech support and they essentially said to bad, sucks to be you.
These c()nts can rot."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"Downloaded the app, entered my number, entered the code and sent right back to the sign in menu, code doesn‚Äôt work at all, deleted and re downloaded. Nothing... literally can‚Äôt even begin the first step of tinder lol... great"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,I don‚Äôt recommend using this dating app!
tinder,ca,11.31.0,2,Yea sorry increasing the age range I‚Äôve set to stop the fun from stopping is not the move. I have purposely set the age range to what I want so I don‚Äôt have to swipe on 18 years olds as a 21 year old female lol it‚Äôs a waste of my time and completely annoying.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,Been banned for almost 1.5 years and I have no idea why. Would be cool if you guys removed this so I can stop asking friends to use their phone numbers to create an account :)
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,I have been banned twice. For literally no reason. I can‚Äôt get my accounts back and I keep having to change what email or phone number I use. Now I have no options left and I have no idea why I was banned
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"No I do not want to send super likes, stop asking me!"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,2,Works but when you upgrade subscription it says it‚Äôs an upgrade and will only cost the balance of the difference then when you get the recipe it‚Äôs the full cost and no refund kinda a shady way of doing business I think
tinder,ca,11.31.0,2,"I use tinder on the rare occasion I open it this morning and I am banned for no reasons, I have received no warning and I followed all the rules. Now I can no longer use this app ever again... thank you very much dev team"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,3,"I‚Äôm not paying $50+ on an app, when I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll like it or not. Regardless you‚Äôll find success on the app if your normal and your profile isn‚Äôt weird or to much"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,I think the tinder team is pretty high headed and thinks that their app is the best. So they lost one user today and they lose many.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"I recently got a new phone number, and when i tried to sign up for an account on tinder I was told that my number had been banned. Tinder is doing nothing to help fix this issue."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,3,Just wanted to make note that I updated to version 11.31.0 and literally nothing loads. All my recent messages are now all over the place in my chat history and I can‚Äôt even scroll through them without it glitching. Just a huge amount of lag for the app overall and can barely use it. Plus I actually pay for tinder gold! üôÉ please fix!
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,Why was tinder gold 19.99 when I made one account but I deleted it and restarted on the same day and not it‚Äôs 39.99?
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"A LOT of fake profiles, escorts, no pictures & no bio.
Don‚Äôt bother with specifying your sexual orientation, the app will completely ignore that and present you with everything that exists under the sun.

Lately the app has been super laggy to the point that it‚Äôs unusable."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,Just make a decent update for once
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"Bugs , que la m√©thode ¬´ glisse ¬ª , et prix trop √©lev√© pour ce que √ßa vaut .

tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,I accidentally put in the wrong year and now I can‚Äôt create an account
tinder,ca,11.31.0,2,Remove the secret admirer random event. It was cute the first two months but yall got greedy and for the last 6 months they‚Äôve all been ‚ÄúSorry maybe next time‚Äù. Now it‚Äôs simply an annoying waste of time
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"This is the only ‚Äúdating‚Äù app that I haven‚Äôt met anyone on. The girls using it are fake, using it for OnlyFans and there‚Äôs lots of bots. Don‚Äôt waste your money!

Tinder also initially shows your profile to people very far away, so it‚Äôs very unlikely you‚Äôll want to meet your matches if you pay to see them."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,2,I just opened my tinder app and all of my recent matches and conversations have all been reset to like a year ago while my profile stayed the same. Also won‚Äôt let me message any one. I am super annoyed by this and would like to know what‚Äôs going on
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,Got banned a long time ago and I did nothing to deserve it. Tried to get ahold of them and ask why so if I did do something against the rules I wont make that mistake other places. Customer service is a joke.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,Should be deleted!
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,I got banned for no reason and they have no customer service to get this fixed I‚Äôve been a paying customer for years this is trash
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"BANNED FOR NO REASON AND THEY WONT EVEN TELL ME WHY? i haven‚Äôt done anything 

tinder sucks now and don‚Äôt DOWNLOAD"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,5,I met my long term boyfriend on tinder then he cheated on me using tinder..  i guess the app just does it‚Äôs job too well
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"Lots of bugs, really annoying...im getting pist off using the app...not worth it."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,3,"The filter for age isn‚Äôt working and shows people below the preset age limit. For example. I set my age limits from 22-42 and 18-19 year olds are showing up and I‚Äôm accidentally hitting yes. 

Can someone fix this please. Thank you."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,With my country‚Äôs lockdown from the pandemic it‚Äôs been very hard to socialize and meet new people and it‚Äôs been very mentally damaging to many people from the isolation. Giving out bans to users with no explanation and having no way of repealing it is doing more harm to people during this unprecedented time then it is good.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,3,I‚Äôm getting ages and distance that aren‚Äôt my preference. You need a fix
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,I‚Äôve been using tinder daily for two years and haven‚Äôt even got a message or match upon further research I learned that tinder shadow and users turning their account into a ghost. What a stupid time. I got two the grocery store and end up with more matches.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"I rarely use this app and when I do, I rarely even talk to people. But I was banned with no reason given? Quite ridiculous if you ask me. See ya, Tinder. I‚Äôll stick with the better dating apps."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"Be very very careful when purchasing any sort of upgrade. Purchased as a one time only thing. Found out months later that the subscription had been auto renewing despite me deleting my account! No support available through the site to rectify the problem. Very Very disappointed in how much money this site has cost me and even more disappointed in the lack of support. Stay away! Anything set up to keep taking your money despite you deleting an account and not having available support to rectify a problem or mistake in my opinion is just there to take your money! 
Shame on you Tinder !"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,I was banned even though I‚Äôm 18. It now says I need to wait 1823 days until I can use the app. That‚Äôs almost 5 years!! ü§¨ü§¨ This app def isn‚Äôt worth your time or money!
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,Banned for being underage for 2000 days. 19 years old. No support.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"All I want is to easily chat with all my matches but the app is too laggy and slow. It‚Äôs too frustrating, even though I‚Äôm paying for a subscription."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,I just downloaded yesterday put all my information in and then I went to sign in today and my stuff is banned? Like how? I didn‚Äôt even use the app? Like are pretty girls not allowed on the app ? They thought I was a fake account? And now I can‚Äôt use tinder at all? How is that fair lol
tinder,ca,11.31.0,3,"Tinder is a great app for its purpose but everyone I talk to has the same problem with it. I live in Canada, 5 minutes from the border, and practically ALL I see are American profiles! Also all of my top picks are from US! There‚Äôs no setting to specify you want them to be in the same country but there should be, we aren‚Äôt even allowed to cross the border right now. Other than this main issue which basically ruins the whole app, it works well and I‚Äôll keep using it but I hope there is a way to fix this in the future."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,2,"My phone is up to date, and so is the app. I tried to trouble shoot my phone by restarting it and such but the lag in the app is out of control. I can‚Äôt even message people because opening a conversation takes minutes on its own. 

TINDER look at your reviews and fix your issues, please."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"I can see that I‚Äôm getting matches from before and messages too! But once I open the app, it glitches out and won‚Äôt work correctly! I‚Äôm losing it!!!"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"This app does not really work unless u pay for the monthly subscription. Even then, it will work for a few days then stop giving you matches..UNLESS You upgrade to the biggest package which it forces you to purchase another month with the additional benefits, THEN matches start pouring in. I‚Äôm sure something is illegal here."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"Hi, 
For an app this big!! It‚Äôs ridiculous you guys can‚Äôt help. Especially in this situation where I have no record of breaking the rules and all of a sudden I was banned for no reason and you tell me to just accept the decision. It‚Äôs totally unfair and I believe I deserve to know why I was banned. Please fix it"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,2,It was good at the start but when I surpassed 1000 matches the app became insanely glitchy and couldn‚Äôt load anything. Now I can‚Äôt even type or send messages.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"I got banned for no reason. And I was enjoying some of the conversations I had, my profile was verified and everything. Garbage"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"Un gars sur votre app m'a donn√© l'herp√®s g√©nital. Un autre s'est invent√© une double vie (travail, √©tude...) et m'a tromp√© avec votre application."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"I really liked tinder, however I deleted it when covid started just due to the situation of the world. Redownloaded the app to find out I had been banned and when I emailed the support yeah I just got a generic ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt do ban appeals!‚Äù message, despite me knowing people who have gotten ban appeals. Very upsetting that this app still does its bans based on user moderation only and has no appeals to counteract this. I‚Äôve seen people saying it‚Äôs mostly for LGBT people so maybe this just isn‚Äôt the app for us."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,Seems to be a on going issue many people are getting banned without reason me being one of them as a paid member I find it wrong that they ban without any warning and they complete ignore there support section to even investigate why you were banned or even wrongly banned please fix this problem
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,I literally got banned for a comment that wasn‚Äôt even bad. I want my account back! I didn‚Äôt even get a strike
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"To many fake accounts , and the real ones either won‚Äôt respond or aren‚Äôt active . Tinder has really gone down the drain"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,3,I got the app when I was under 18 and deleted that account but trying to get in now when I am 18 wont let me no matter what I do
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,So I was permanently banned for being ‚Äúunder the age of 18‚Äù when I am in fact 18 years old and have the documents to prove it. Customer support was extremely unhelpful. They need a much better policy in place for things like bans. I can never use the app again because of it.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,Msyjendrr
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,Went to log in and it says my account is banned I emailed customer service and they could not give me a reason to why I got banned I asked several times and they all said could not give me a reason why so not sure if I was hacked or what but a useless site stay away
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"Went to check the app and it stated I was banned, the app states that they do not look into it at all even if you submit a request. There was nothing on my profile that violated the terms of use maybe it‚Äôs another bug? All I know is that seems that this happens to lots of people and the app creators aren‚Äôt interested in fixing. Had people messaging me on other apps asking why I ghosted them.. awkward"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,I was a longtime Tinder user and got banned without any warning and explanation.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"Random people can make you banned so easily, even if you re not disrespectful or violate any terms. If somebody don‚Äôt like you and report you, that‚Äôs it. They won‚Äôt even tell you why you‚Äôre banned, because they don‚Äôt know it themselves. It simply needs for somebody to dislike you."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,This app just always gives me troubles. Whether it‚Äôs a notification not going away or a message not loading. It‚Äôs been like this for 3 phones and ages. Considering it‚Äôs a fairly popular app you‚Äôd think they could get the basics down...
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,This app is a complete scam. I had my account for 4 years until it suddenly got banned (right after I paid $50 for premium). They don‚Äôt even have a ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù option where you can message them to help fix this error. Just use Bumble instead.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,2,My friends said he can go anywhere in the world I just tried and it tried to charge me 34.99
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"Tinder just banned me for no apparent reason.. been using it casually without violating any terms and opened the app today to find myself banned. No way to appeal or resolve it. 1/5 stars.
Just lost a user."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,Even if you buy tinder gold or what ever. You still won‚Äôt be get any match or likes. As the booster comes once a monthüòÇ like seriously. After spending for gold member you still have to boost the profile. What nonsense is that.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"This app is built to grab your wallet. Don‚Äôt waste your money and time on this garbage. Go meet some real, genuine people in real-life for free. Don‚Äôt fall into the trap of online dating."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,3,I love tinder but I was banned today and I have no idea why. My profile was never under review or anything. I wish there was something that told you why you were banned other that ‚Äúyou broke community guidelines‚Äù
tinder,ca,11.31.0,2,The apps always glitch/freeze or say I can‚Äôt match with them WHEN we actually matched. Plz tinder fix ur app.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,Care about your privacy? Read the ENTIRE policy. You‚Äôll never use it. Not to mention the fact that it‚Äôs full of fake profiles.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,For some reason i got banned and i had recently paid for something in app and i was never able to get my money back so im quite deceived.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,I was randomly banned without even committing any violations :/
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,Made an account less than 24 hours ago after not using the app for a couple years. Banned in less than a day without even messaging anyone.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"Hello, I tried making an account about a week ago, and put in the wrong year, now it won‚Äôt let me make an account for 750 days. Please delete my phone number and email from your data base so I can make an account. Thanks:)"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"Canceller cet application svp

Et rembourser le dernier paiement svp

Merci"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"Worst app ever !!! When I first downloaded tinder is was fun but then all of the sudden I couldn‚Äôt match with anyone and none of my messages where going thru! One of my matches had added me on Snapchat and informed me he couldn‚Äôt even find my account anymore it was completely MIA. I emailed tinder. Didn‚Äôt hear back for almost a week! My account was fixed with ZERO explanation. At this point I had been paying for a tinder subscription for 2 months already. Fast forward a few weeks, I had been on in at least a two weeks. So I went on, messaged a few people. Closed the app. When I went to go back into Tinder. It said my account had been banned !! I didn‚Äôt violate any terms of use of community guidelines !! Again, emailed Tinder. Heard back a few days later saying ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no appeal process for banned accounts‚Äù so now I‚Äôm banned for life with ZERO explanation. If I could rate this app negative stars , I would !!! Don‚Äôt bother wasting your time !!"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"I just got banned for absolutely no reason, I didn‚Äôt even go against their terms or rules. I wasn‚Äôt doing anything wrong than all of the sudden I am banned for life? I think Tinder needs to fix this problem and stop banning people for no reason, even a friend of mine got banned for no reason."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,2,"If you purchase a level of tinder, delete your profile and are sign up, say goodbye to your money. Also, I've been stuck in ‚Äúverify you're human‚Äù mode. Lots of glitches. Hiring me as a software tester :) k bye."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,It says 17+ but when I put in my birthday (I am 17) it banned me. Ok...
tinder,ca,11.31.0,3,il faudrait inciter les gens a plus se parler
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"I got banned roughly 3-4 years ago. I‚Äôm gay and I usually just swipe with guys, never got banned, no reason to be banned, just your ol‚Äô guys swiping to meet guys. One day my friend wanted to swipe girls using my account to see if they would swipe on me too. We swiped, I got a few matches, said hi to some, told them I was gay then immediately unmatched me. The following day I opened my tinder and I was still banned, let‚Äôs get this straight.. if a girl doesn‚Äôt like how I respond just for being gay, or me making an account to pose as gay, they could just report me once and ban me? I tried opening tinder again today in the hopes of something being changed, you know it I‚Äôm still banned. Where‚Äôs the equality between guys and girls? Why would I get for just wanting to befriend other girls? Before getting banned I was using tinder for a year or two and never had any problems. Swiped my options to girls for a few hours then a day later I got banned? Seriously where‚Äôs my voice? Accusing me to be a bot? Accusing me to be a catfish? Accusing me to having a fake account or being a spam? I should‚Äôve had a plea before hand. This is one sided, revise the system and reconstruct how this banning works."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,I didn‚Äôt make a sexual comment or say anything inappropriate and I still got banned
tinder,ca,11.31.0,2,Why am I banned and customer service won‚Äôt even turn their heads
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"Not impressed with this app at all.  Super glitchy, and the feedback is outrageous.  Also, most people on here don‚Äôt care for anything serious in a relationship.  They just want a quick way to boost their egos."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,I‚Äôve been seen the same people over the weekend since I open the app. Got tinder platinum & boost with no results. Such a waste of money and time. The app used to work fine a year ago when I last used it
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"This app has become so laggy it's impossible to use without getting mad. It is very irritating to perform any action and wait up to 5 seconds for a reponse! Also, old matches fron two years ago pop up on top of the catalogue, very confusing! FIX TINDER"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"I‚Äôve downloaded tinder many times, it use to be good but not anymore since a good number of profiles are not respecting the purpose of this app, instead they put almost nudes pics and promote their Instagram and snapshat, maybe the developers should consider an option to ban promotion of other plateform by these Attention W, peace"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"Been banned on all my devices, i have no idea why. they just banned me one day and didn‚Äôt give a reason. I was also a paying member. it would‚Äôve been nice to know why i was banned in the least."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,Tinder bans you based on something they feel you might‚Äôve done by not. Following their terms. But does not leave any room for any explanation regarding to why or how you might‚Äôve got ban. Also they don‚Äôt give you any option to appeal or try and get back on the app.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,I even paid for a month of premium membership and I wake up one morning and ALL my matches are gone... waste of money waste of time.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"One of the most buggy apps I‚Äôve ever used. Constantly crashes, freezes, and lags. For the love of God you‚Äôre a billion dollar company. Hire some real developers who actually know what they‚Äôre doing."
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,Don‚Äôt really like tinder at all get no matches compared to all my other dating app
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"Your latest update made things worse. I was in the middle of a conversation, planning a socially distant activity and it just crashed and deleted him. Suing Tinder for my singleness lol"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"I got banned for no reasons after months of not using the app! My friend received the same message as I, not cool! seems to be a trend now when reading previous comments. Tinder gotta do something about this issue"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"All fake profiles to take your money 
Stop with the blue stars to take your money 
Tinder sucks give out the blue stars for free
Kijiji doesn‚Äôt charge !!!!! 
Tinder sucks !!!!"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,2,"Hey tinder is still extremely slow for some reason, i just updated the most recent one again & its still very glitchy and slow if that can get fixed then everything else is good üòå so far"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,2,Ya know during this time its hard to find people! And you guys ban me for no explanation at all.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,I wish they put as much effort into stopping scammers on the app as they do into spamming users with pop-ups and click bait notifications
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,I had a lot of matches and then it would say ‚Äúfail error to match‚Äù to ever single person I‚Äôd match with. I was also having really good conversations and then I stopped receiving all messages. I haven‚Äôt gotten a single match or message for 3 days. I even got tinder gold to see if that was the problem but it wasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm super mad cuz I had so many connections. I‚Äôve tried deleting the app. Logging in and out. And I even restarted my phone. I‚Äôm just super upset and probably won‚Äôt get it again.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,I‚Äôve been age restricted even though I‚Äôm 18 and every time I try and verify my age it tells me that I‚Äôm not 18 and won‚Äôt let me try again for 24 hours. This is so frustrating.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,NOBODY IS ACTIVE DO NOT PAY
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,Won‚Äôt even let me make a profile. Try to choose pictures and it just says oops. lol fail.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,I got hacked and they got me banned. Tinder didn‚Äôt do anything to help me either they just said it was my fault and they won‚Äôt get my account back.
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,"The app itself is slightly better than it used to be, fewer crashes. Sadly, 9/10 profiles are fake. Time to implement a better verification system? Granted, they won‚Äôt because they want you to pay to see what fake profiles are sitting there waiting for you to match. üòä"
tinder,ca,11.31.0,1,I am a black woman who has done nothing wrong and was banned for zero reason. I sent an appeal and nothing. Tinder look into this please because it seems to be a trend. It may be because I had a lot of matches but didn‚Äôt pay a dime. Reply me tinder please. This is ridiculous
tinder,ca,11.30.0,3,"tried signing up and when i put in my birthday, told me i‚Äôm not over 18 and to come in 680 days. i‚Äôm 19 and put in my birth year correctly"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Banned for absolutely no reason.
I wrote an email to customer service and they have never answered me.

I was having a good time using this app, and now it s a week that I‚Äôm banned.
Not cool.
Please fix this."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Tinder has always been FULL of men requesting sex and generally inappropriate behaviour. Perhaps it‚Äôs because I sarcastically ask if men will put money in the bank after they ask for pornographic images. 

I have paid for tinder plus as I am in remote northern Alberta and enjoy the chance to connect with men from a more dense population. If I am shadow banned I would like my account refunded. 

Going to take a stab and assume this app is run by men. It‚Äôs fine for men to be superficial and inappropriate but women can‚Äôt reciprocate...? 

There‚Äôs no way to even email for support to get this dealt with. The app won‚Äôt let me delete my account so I can use a different dating app to meet someone."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,I changed my profile picture from my face to a heart and tinder banned my account. What the hell? And there is no way to contact them to appeal it. What a joke.
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,The fact that it‚Äôs mandatory to PAY to see who‚Äôs liked me is absolutely ridiculous. I will (unfortunately) pay your monthly thing but god damn! This app is unbelievably greedy. (Somebody liked you! Oh boy let‚Äôs see who liked me! Give us money you WILL NOT see who liked you until you pay up.) I don‚Äôt wanna be THAT person but I demand you set things right and change how that works. That is incredibly stupid.
tinder,ca,11.30.0,3,I‚Äôm getting notifications as I get matches but when I open It doesn‚Äôt show any new matches  or any respond to any of them
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,I got banned for no reason and I came here to tapk about it and you delete my review ?! WOW. By the way I‚Äôm still banned and y‚Äôall better let me get unbanned!
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,Says I have a bunch of likes but only get a match every few weeks. And when you put in within 50km it should just stay in that distance! Mine seems to do whatever the hell it wants it annoying! So I downloaded somthing else.
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,I WAS BANNED FOR NO REASON AT ALL AND YOU CANT REQUEST FOR ANY SORT OF REVIEW TO GET UNBANNED !!! STUPID !!
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,The app verified that I'm human... And that's it. Can't get past that screen and can't use the app.
tinder,ca,11.30.0,3,My account has been banned. I have not done anything wrong or said any thing wrong or posted any inappropriate pics so I am scratching my head wondering why I was banned. And no where tells me why. I‚Äôm very confused.
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,I‚Äôve been age restricted on this app and I don‚Äôt know how to verify or get my account back it‚Äôs been months.
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"They will just ban you no warning, spent money on a membership and got verified, just to wake up one morning banned. No prior warnings issued"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,5,Will bring you your own person lightning McQueen after like maybe 3 years
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"EDIT: If you complain, they ban you.  Full of spam accounts but if you complain about it. They ban you?"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,2,If I swipe left on someone I don‚Äôt want them showing again
tinder,ca,11.30.0,5,Jus sayin
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,I am not underage and I‚Äôm not taken I‚Äôm looking for someone to talk to but I always get banned for no reason
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Stop banning users for no reason, it has been over a year I‚Äôve tried to retrieve my account after being banned for no reason. I hadn‚Äôt been on the app in months and when I had try to go back on I had that fun message and nothing to do about it. Fix this issue if you want users to stay engaged with your app... isn‚Äôt that the whole point??"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"had the app for a month and zero likes then the subscription ran out and overnight i got 17 likes, pushing me to subscribe to see lol"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,It‚Äôs impossible
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,Tired of seeing the same people over and over and over. When you swipe left that should be it. Such a waste of time swiping to eventually get to new people. üòë
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"I‚Äôve done nothing but text, nothing near sexual, and while I was texting someone I magically get banned out of nowhere, and I can‚Äôt get back into my account, the worst part is they didn‚Äôt give me any reasons or proof I‚Äôve broken any guidelines"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,2,I receive an email that says that i have a message but when i open the app I can‚Äôt see anything
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,No one encounter in 4 months since my registration... nothing serious here. Lots of hackers only
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,I started using tinder and everything was going good. I got busy with work and was not using it for a bit and when I came back i somehow got banned without any explanations and not opportunity to ask for review of the file. I double checked the privacy policy and user agreement and I have not violated a single point. Very disappointing to say the least.
tinder,ca,11.30.0,3,"Good app easy to use no bugs, would like option to not be shown trans people as a setting ."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,I just subscribed literally went through maybe five profiles like two of them went to go back in and check it and all of a sudden my account is band? I find this ridiculous add my personal pictures profile for it to be banned and now I have no way to go in and delete it or see if my profile still exist THANX!
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"As many do , i deleted the app after meeting up with a guy, didn't really work out so we stopped dating and I downloaded the app again. 

To find out that Im banned for no reasonü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Ive been using the same old tinder account for the past 5+ years üòÇ

What ever the reason is im sure maybe its best like this. Tinder has never helped me build actual good and healthy relationships. 

This app is kinda garbage not gonna lie"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,I obeyed all the rules and my account got banned for no reason I don‚Äôt understand. I had all my matches and now it‚Äôs all gone. This is so stupid. Please I need my account back
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Just scroll through the most recent reviews, there is either a glitch or an algorithm that banns users by the masses. There is also no appeal process. Unfortunately for me I had already purchased a gold membership, and lost money. If you do use this service I‚Äôd strongly discourage buying any membership and assume that you can be banned at anytime for no reason."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Never shared anything explicit or against the rules and out of the blue got banned. No where to contest this, and no explanation of what I did wrong."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"App keeps crashing every 2-5min, even after updating/ deleting."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,The app is freezing all the time. Very slow
tinder,ca,11.30.0,2,"Got banned for NO reason. No guidelines were broken and why the hell are you not allowing appeals this is for sure a glitch. I‚Äôm now banned forever for nothing and I payed money for tinder gold. This is Robbery literally.

Another thing MAKE IT SO YOU CAN DELETE MESSAGES. If you make a typo it doesn‚Äôt let you delete it‚Äôs terrible.

And WHY ARE MY DISTANCE SETTINGS GETTING IGNORED IM GETTING PEOPLE WAY TO FAR AWAY.

This is post to be the ‚Äúnumber 1 app for dating‚Äù"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"I‚Äôve spent hundreds of dollars on this app over the years and you banned me for no reason . Not even an explanation. Should be criminal.
I‚Äôve reached out many times"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,I got 50% fake matches.... thats very bad and when i buy platinum I start getting matches but after some days again it become like simple version of tinder
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"For some unknown reason, my account got banned for a long time now. No reason given, not even a warning. I have no nudity on the app nor inappropriate languages for me to get banned, and I am of legal age. This is the worst dating app that will banned your account without giving you a reason to why."

tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,I used tinder occasionally to meet new people and out of nowhere I was banned permanently. I completely followed their terms of service so i‚Äôm just :///
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Don‚Äôt bother, the app sucks, at least in my area. A huge majority of the ads are scams for websites or ppl trying to get you to clink links."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Most are only there to boost their ego and for attention that they get. Tinder should ban these type of girl, if you are to just do a collection of matches, this apps is not made for you."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,2,This app could be good but as a woman the ugliest guys are on here .
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"This is worst quality app ever. The app is extremely slow, takes forever to load, and keep crashing. It takes forever to complete any actions on the app such as swiping right on a profile or even opening a message. I did everything I could (such as deleting and reinstalling the app, ensuring my data/wifi is great, force shutting all apps, restarting my iPhone, etc.). This has been going on for over two weeks. I sent several messages to tinder over the past two weeks (the most recent No. 17622603)  but still no reply. I have been using Tinder for over 4 years but this never happened. All other dating apps like Bumble, Badoo, Okcupid, etc still works great. What a terrible customer service, Tinder!"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,5,So happy
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"I bought one yesterday suscription, and got banned three months later. Not a single inappropriate pic, not a single argument with anyone.

Since the payment is yearly, they‚Äôre basically pocketing the rest of the subscription, since there‚Äôs no one to complain. 

Nonetheless, I will keep fighting my reimbursement."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,5,"As a lesbian woman, I‚Äôve had success with the free version of this app for various connections - longterm friendships, relationships and dates. I appreciate that only mutual matches can communicate with each other, unlike traditional dating sites."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,When will tinder make an app that works for men? Tinder only caters to women.
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Honestly such a waste of time and money. Got banned for no reason and cannot make another account. No explanation on to why i was banned, customer service doesnt help at all! I will not change my one star review until either something about this is fixed or tinder decides to do a reset wave."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,The app has been SO SLOW AND JANKY especially recently. Literally not useable. New messages do not load in and any action takes 3 seconds to perform (iPhone XS).
tinder,ca,11.30.0,5,You guys need to download it right now this is so amazing I literally found me soulmate Shrek on this but don‚Äôt tell Fionaü§´üòÅ
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Quand vous avez √©puis√© votre recherche c‚Äôest fini, ne pensez plus regarder les photos au cas o√π vous auriez oubli√© quelques choses et les coups de c≈ìur qui reviennent au bout de 24h. J‚Äôai m√™me pay√© pour √ßa... quelle erreur j‚Äôai fais. N‚Äôaller pas la svp"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,Got banned from tinder and no reason for it.
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"My app has been suuuuuuuper glitchy and I have to delete and redownload it whenever I get messages. I‚Äôve tried simply quitting the app and refreshing but to no avail. Also, there are a lot of fakes and I still end up getting shown male profiles when I put my preferences strictly to women."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,got banned for no real reason and was refused any help or answers
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,I was permanently banned without being given a reason or a chance to appeal the decision by any means. I‚Äôve always acted as a gentleman on this app yet I somehow have been banned. I guess Tinder really is one big joke
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,Sends you 3 notifications a day you can‚Äôt turn off unless you want to disable all notifications and not know when someone messages you.
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Edit: got banned for no reason. Terrible app.

Not matches but the app it‚Äôs self doesn‚Äôt work. Things won‚Äôt load, everything glitches, the app freezes all the time.

I have updated my phone and the app. 
Logged out and logged back in.
Turned off my phone, reinstalled the app and no luck. No other apps do this and it‚Äôs been glitchy for the past two weeks."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,3,"My profile is set to woman and lesbian. Men should not be showing up on my tinder, but I see them a lot, also there are tons of couples looking for a third which shouldn‚Äôt be showing up on my account either."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,i put the wrong year of birth and now it won‚Äôt let me reset it and i can‚Äôt get into tinder for 949 days. so stupid. i can‚Äôt even re set it
tinder,ca,11.30.0,4,"Personally i have not had much success with the app, restarted my profile a week and a half ago and it matched me with a scammer and a ghoster (who i was beginning to like, although not tinders fault) and 4 total likes. I feel as though tinder is not showing me at all due to having max distance, swiping liberally(on girls who look like they get 50 matches per day) and have a decently appealing profile but I get nothing myself. Most of this is prob not tinders fault but im not entirely sure as per 4*s."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,Tinder was a great app I even purchased the tinder premium and then one day I tried to open the app and it said I was banned and after reading the terms and services I have not violated anything and have done nothing wrong so I decided to talk to maybe a customer support but that doesn‚Äôt exist because they don‚Äôt care about their customers Tinder if you are seeing this and their is a way to find out why I was banned or to talk to someone to get my account backI will gladly remove this review and talk to someone to find out how I have violated the terms and services
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Yup many years ago I would be getting many matches consistently and now every time I make a tinder, I get matches the first few days then nothing, I‚Äôm pretty good looking It‚Äôs just tinder doesn‚Äôt show me anymore.... this shot is pissing me off so much that I should create my own app to destroy tinder.... f"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,Fix this garbage
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Bonne ou mauvaise c‚Äôest √† discuter. 
Mais c‚Äôest la pire application en terme de bugs, d‚Äôanomalies et probl√®mes de d√©veloppement. Des matchs se disparaissent, des messages ne s‚Äôaffichent plus..
Gra a a a a aveeee (d√©sol√© c‚Äôest un TinderBug)"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Site mercantile ... le but de tinder est de vous faire payer le plus possible ... messieurs allez sur d autre site du m√™me genre ils seront bien moins cher . Les algorithmes du syst√®mes tinder font tout pour vous arnaquer ... 
allez sur bumble , nettement moins commercial"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Banned for no reason after having non stop issues with the app. Never get notifications, also wouldn‚Äôt swipe the right way leading Into matches and uncomforable Incounters with people I didn‚Äôt want to match with. So many problems befor I was banned. Not sure why I‚Äôm banned either I don‚Äôt use the app often due to its issues. Highly don‚Äôt reccomend this app at all."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"I won't talk about the many bugs this app has bc we all know them very well. I had an account, and in my bio I wrote about my relationship preferences, I like bdsm and stuff, at first I was maybe so explicit (Tinder criteria ü§†), then I changed it in order to not say too much but let my potential matches know what kinds of things I like to do with my partners, nothing specific, just mentioning D/s relationships. I got banned anyway, and now I can't even log in in a different account in my cellphone :) I find this absolutely ridiculous"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,What a joke
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"When I registered, I got a notification that I am underage and thus, cannot access the app. Funny part was that I just messed up with typing in my birth date, but that part is still on me. Yet, I was supposed to ‚Äúturn eighteen‚Äù a few weeks ago, according to the information I gave about myself. When I logged in a few days ago, my account was banned. I never uploaded photos, never communicated, never was on Tinder, and I got banned. Then, I emailed Tinder support, and bot replied that they don‚Äôt unblock people because they don‚Äôt.
I mean sure, cuz why would they hire people who would actually review those messages, right?
Terrible"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"HORRIBLE APP! Glitchy like crazy .. for the amount of money tinder has to be taking in, you‚Äôd think they could create a support team to help people when they over charge , double charge and then cancel early. No problem taking your money but try to get support and it‚Äôs a joke. I‚Äôd give zero stars if I could. I‚Äôd NEVER recommend this app."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"If you‚Äôre a straight white man, you have no chance."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Someone reported me for adding ‚ÄòQueer‚Äô to my profile, and Tinder does not have an appeal process. If you‚Äôre in any way marginalized, use caution with this app ‚Äì you may be prone to targeted harassment, and no one will help you. The terms of service are apolitical, i.e. do not contain special provisions for oppressed peoples. You could get banned for saying something critical of cops, for example. Not a good look!"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Any user can report you for any reason and you get banned 
There is no system in place for appeals 

So you talk to someone they ask for a x rated pic, you don‚Äôt send it, they report you and you get banned and they do nothing about it 

I would give negative stars if I could

Everyone should report the app to Apple get the app taken down or systems changed"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,Got banned from Tinder for absolutely no reason but they allow disgusting men to write women sexual messages and they do not get banned. Wrote an email to them and they said once guidelines are ‚Äúviolated‚Äù they ban you for life. I am now device banned and can never use Tinder again on my phone because of men reporting me due to me not responding to them talking about their coc*s. Absolutely disgusting that in 2020 women are still being held accountable for men not being able to keep it in their pants. Will be sharing this with everyone I know so they delete the app :)
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,More fake profiles than real (you can tell them apart by the invitations to Snap for nudes...).
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"I wrote that I was turning 18 instead of 19 in a few months, which was a typo. I pressed the 8 by accident because it was beside the 9. And I instantly got banned! I hate this app. Hate it. Please cancel tinder."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"I have been on it for many years and never found the right match , more so I have never violated the terms yet I got banned for no reason given. I will never use this again and suggest no one to do so . I see many people on hereHarassing , offering money offering sex, this is not violating their terms.? Haha very funny but when I never used any of these got banned . It‚Äôs just ridiculous. Ibelieve people should be given second chance. I have email tinder and they came up with no good reason continuously repeating that I have violated the terms . People should be able to given second chance specially that they have been on tinder for many years and never violated the terms . This is just ridiculous."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"I'm not sure what good paying for premium is when Tinder now tries 50 times a day to get me to buy more super likes or upgrade to Platinum whenever I swipe right on someone. 

Here's a thought, if I want to buy your other products, I'll do it. I don't need to be reminded they exist every single day."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Idk if this is a glitch or what but you might as well just skip tinder and go straight to Hinge. They are just banning everyone for no reason what so ever, that fact is all over the internet. For awhile if you had BLM in your bio you got banned. Yet I‚Äôve blocked and reported two different guys and they were able to keep their accounts and verbally abuse me anytime I accidentally swiped right on their profiles. I‚Äôm so mad at tinder for not even giving me a reason or warning. I‚Äôve never been anything but respectful and polite. Makes absolutely no sense, don‚Äôt bother putting time into it if everyone is just going to get banned... which you can‚Äôt even appeal. I doubt this review will even help me seeing as so many have written about the same thing and many seem to go unanswered. 

It‚Äôs sad that a multibillion dollar company won‚Äôt take the time to properly review reports or look into whatever this is. I‚Äôve put so many hours and dollars into this app to get nothing in return. Thanks for wasting my time and banning me when I finally found someone I was really vibing with and now they probably think I don‚Äôt like them.  This is so unjustified and messed up. 

Edit: even emailed the app developer that‚Äôs going on here and commenting on all the reviews saying that he will ‚Äúhelp‚Äù you. Absolutely useless, he told me they won‚Äôt review my case and I will remain banned. This is appalling."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,2,Bruhhh you have to stop sending me notifications saying ‚Äúyou missed a match‚Äù I don‚Äôt care. No one does. Stop it.
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"I‚Äôve had tinder no problem for years and then all of a sudden I open the app to find out I‚Äôve been banned? And for no particular reason? I didn‚Äôt give any false info, don‚Äôt have inappropriate things on my profile, never was inappropriate towards anyone and yet I‚Äôm not permanently banned? On top of it all, there‚Äôs no official customer support to help users dispute their claims."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,2,So I‚Äôm 19 years old I spent some money on this app and the next thing I know I‚Äôm banned for being too ‚Äúyoung‚Äù ya kidding me ? I was born in the summer of 2001 what a joke
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Guys, there is an age preference on the app for a reason. I am tired of seeing people outside the age range show up all the time, especially 18 year olds. No one wants to match with them!!! Fix it!"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,Many people post half naked pictures on tinder. When I posted a shirtless picture as a male I was banned for life without a warning. F*** this app!! There‚Äôs not even an application review process to recover the account. This is a poorly managed app with shady false accounts and countless ads.
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,Got banned for terms of use which I didn‚Äôt get any explanation for I also paid for premium I‚Äôm still waiting for answer before I back charge what you charged me for premium.
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"I was using free Tinder for years without any problem. As soon as I decide to try Tinder Gold, I get banned from the app for no reason at all. This seems to be a recurring problems for people who buy subscriptions. So never buy Tinder Gold or Premium.

Congrats on banning your paying customers,  Tinder."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Updated the app the other day, the app is extremely laggy or crashes. Especially with the pop up of asking if I‚Äôm interested in the video chat feature in each message. I just want to see what the person has messaged me, not be bombarded with this would I like to enable video chat with this person taking up a quarter of my screen. There‚Äôs definitely a better way to incorporate this feature. Also adding in this feature, 9 months into the pandemic seems a bit slow."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"This app is glitched and bans have been rolling out to me and my friends for no reason. Do not download, use hinge or bumble instead. I also paid a $50 subscription for platinum which the support robots did not take into account. Such a shame a company around this long still has no clue what it‚Äôs doing."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,Caught my man cheating with this app 0/10 would not recommend
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"So tinder banned me for no reason. I did not display any nudity, racism, threats Ect....
Probably some hurt little boy reporting me or smth. There are racist conservatives killing animals on there so why aren‚Äôt their accounts banned huh? And someone legit posted a picture of him tying up some naked girl which I know was reported multiple times, which is valid for getting reported. But did it get taken down? No. But when I post pics and show a tiny bit of skin as a girl I get reported. I even emailed tinder and explained it all to them but they would not give me back my account and it does not work when u use another number ppl just so u know. 
So before banning random girls account first ban all The racist and sexist guys who r dangerous 
TINDER DO BETTER!!!!"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Ok so every time I use this app i leave my preferences that i don‚Äôt want people who are more than 45 KM away to show up however within a couple days it‚Äôs all like over 150KM away results so i delete my account make a new one and same couple days it‚Äôs ok then it makes 85% of what i see way too far away. I had no idea how to solve this so i thought maybe tinder gold will make it work and it did, i didn‚Äôt even want tinder gold but i wanted to see if it‚Äôd work with it, the fact that the app won‚Äôt properly work u till you‚Äôve paid money is kinda slimy and for that reason i‚Äôm giving 1 star."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Tinder will ban your account when you‚Äôve done nothing wrong, and won‚Äôt even give you a reason or let you appeal. If you want your money to go down the drain and the matches you manage to get to be whisked away for no reason at all, Tinder is the perfect app for you."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"I had made a profile and had been using the app which functioned no to badly. I met this awesome girl whom I chatted back and forth with over the course of a few days. We really took a liking this one another and so we had decided that we where going to exchange phone numbers that evening. 

When I arrived home that evening I opened up the app only to see that my account had been banned and I‚Äôve got absolutely no idea why. All I can think of is maybe my account had been hacked which makes me wonder how well Tinder‚Äôs screening process actually works. She was awesome and so this was really crappy. 

Shame on you tinder!"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,3,I can use tinder because it says I‚Äôm not of age even tho I‚Äôm 19 and I‚Äôm using my Apple ID and I tried re installing the app and still has age restriction
tinder,ca,11.30.0,2,"It‚Äôs great that you notify me of a like, not sure why I have to pay for that or play this guessing game for the review. Dating is difficult enough. Your company makes it harder."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,Once you sign up  for gold or platinum you‚Äôll stop getting matches. Additionally you will not be shown all the people who swiped right on you like your supposed to and will randomly match people that weren‚Äôt in the ‚Äúliked you‚Äùsection. it‚Äôs a ploy to get costumers to buy boosts.
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,J‚Äôutilise cette application depuis longtemps et pour je ne sais quelle raison j‚Äôai √©t√© bannie.
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"You will be banned without warning for no reason, and they don‚Äôt have a process to review your ban.  No way to get a refund either, clearly a very corrupt business."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Bought premium & got banned 4 days later with no notice & no warning.
100% never said anything against guidelines, have sent multiple emails to support with no response. 
Furthermore after I got banned & assumed that my subscription was cancelled because I have no account..... tinder charged me for another full month, when I didn‚Äôt even have the app installed on my phone. 
An absolute JOKE of an application and a JOKE of user support."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"my app worked for a month or so after my last review and is now glitching again, crashes all the time, and i keep getting messages really late???"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"If you go on google, you will see reports from other people about this issue: being permanently banned for no reason. In my case, I hadn‚Äôt even had a conversation for a week and I woke up one day and was banned forever. I emailed the company and they don‚Äôt tell you why, just a generic email about the community guidelines. It was only when I saw on google that so many others were having this issue that I started to think this was a result of a sloppily coded algorithm. I can‚Äôt imagine actual human beings are out there permanently banning people for fun.

Would not recommend. I invested time in, and had it all wasted.

Edit: I also notice that if you scroll through the reviews here you will see plenty of people complaining about the exact same thing."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"I‚Äôve never experienced another app with the banning problem that Tinder has. I have never had an inappropriate exchange with anyone while I was a Tinder user. My photos and convos have all been appropriate and I‚Äôve never solicited money or posted a paypal link, etc. I was a casual user around the time that I was banned, and had actually stopped using the app because I was talking to someone I‚Äôd met off of it. Things didn‚Äôt work out, and when I opened the app again after a week of not being active, I was banned. They gave me no reasoning and no opportunity to contact anyone to dispute the action. Clearly I was extremely confused since I have always followed their guidelines. 
My best guess is that I was reported by the guy that I‚Äôd been talking to after things didn‚Äôt work out. If that‚Äôs the case, it‚Äôs RIDICULOUS to allow frivolous reporting to lead to the banning of a user who has always behaved appropriately. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this app to anyone who doesn‚Äôt enjoy constantly walking on very thin ice for absolutely no reason."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,"Girls are just promoting their IG or Onlyfans, they don‚Äôt even respond and even with Platinum you got matches for a day or two and after that nothing. (Im a good looking guy)"
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,I got shadow banned for no reason and wasn‚Äôt aware of it till way after it happened now I can‚Äôt delete my account sorry but tinder is trash now now the app is slow and freezing
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,I got banned for no reason. There is no way to communicate with them... I wrote an e-mail and they never answered. I don‚Äôt recommand this app at all. Use bumble instead!
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,I didn‚Äôt know that tinder just bans people for no reason? No explanation? No nothing? Reading the previous reviews it seems this is a common occurrence and you can get banned for someone simply not liking you anymore. At least some explanation and reasoning would be nice.
tinder,ca,11.30.0,4,"Every time I open the app then close it, it shows 2 notifications even though it says I have no new messages or matches in the app. I need to force close the app, open it and then when it‚Äôs on the loading screen I need to force close it again to get rid of it. But since the new update, the notifications just stay there and won‚Äôt go away."
tinder,ca,11.30.0,1,Worst app ever just get bumble
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"They keep user data on you even after you delete your account, so if you‚Äôre banned you‚Äôre banned. This app is such a scam meant to restrict what you can do and who you can meet unless you pay them their high and growing prices. Bumble is better but has similar practices, Hinge is also much better and seems honest... but I‚Äôve met more women posting selfies on Instagram than I have paying for Tinder. 

Tinder also hates men. Women can pretty much do what they want on the app with impunity while guys will get shadow-banned or outright removed permanently without reason or recourse. At this point, Tinder is just a way to look at fake photos of people. 

Tinder is the gutter of the dating app world. This is my first ever app review! Took the time to let y‚Äôall know."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,So it‚Äôs okay that you charge women less for tinder gold then you do men. Interesting.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Switched my phone number and tried signing up, but last person who had this number got banned. I emailed an appeal explaining this but was told my number was banned and tinder is not looking into unbanning anyone."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"So I just got banned with no explanation after signing up for their premium service, there is absolutely no customer service. I‚Äôve tried contacting them and all I get is automated messages giving me no explanation why they think it‚Äôs okay to deny service after taking my money."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Banned for literally nothing.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,I been banned for so long for no reason. Emailed a bunch and couldn‚Äôt be unbanned. Y‚Äôall trippin
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"says you‚Äôve matched just to get you to open the app and continue swiping, and swipe with every person for the next 20 and not of them was the apparent matcher? and gold is like 20 bucks a month? go f yourselves."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,3,J‚Äôaimerais me d√©sabonner. Quelle est le chemin pour y arriver? Je ne le trouve pas.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,How do I become un-banned? I didn't have any nudity in my pictures or nothing offensive in my bio? I'm not sure how this happened. Very disappointed üò¢
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,They ban you and there‚Äôs no appeal. You can try contacting customer service but they only send automated messages and there‚Äôs no real way to speak to a representative to discuss your ban.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"I recently tried to login into the app and learned my account was banned. I have been a Tinder user for the past 4 years and a gold user for the past two years and had some great connections and a few relationships from using the app, so this was quite saddening to learn. The main problem is there is no way to learn why or get in contact with someone to know why you are banned. I have always been respectful in my messages and with my profile, so I don't quite understand what happened. So if you are a paying member and get banned there is no refund option or ban appeal process."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,5,"It really irritates me when people like you but they don‚Äôt show up when you swipe, them I waste all my likes and those likes go away, can you please take away tinder gold. It shouldn‚Äôt cost money to find love. You care more about the profit than the people who actually use this. I‚Äôm tired of wasting my time. Please fix this. Or give the ability to see likes and match with them. Thank you."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,I got banned out of nowhere for no reason and they won‚Äôt do anything to fix it
tinder,ca,11.29.0,3,Its ok ! but For me as a sugar daddy logandmeet.com was better
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,"Paying 27 bucks for a tinder platinum a month out here, throw the kid some perks with it.. maybe unlimited super likes? Unlimited top picks? Show some respect for a VIP of tinder. ALSO! Wayyyy to many fake tinder people. Everyone should have to verify a photo of themselves when making an account, a lot of creeps pretending to be other people on here."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"this app needs an update it's very buggy still i don't even get to see people and my messages aren't going through i have to log in and log out, i've deleted my profile and made a new one but am STILL having the same problems. FIX THIS"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Like many people here, I got banned for a reason I do not know. Contacted them and got an automated message not explaining why, and basically saying its permanent. Being banned wouldn't be so bad but they cant even take the time to tell you what you did wrong. And thats super frustrating, did I do something wrong? I‚Äôll never know if tinders algorithm just sucks and bans people, or if I‚Äôm subconsciously a terrible ***hole."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Bruh my profile was appropriate and my pictures and I got my account banned
I‚Äôm 18 years and not a minor like lots of ppl try to lie about their age"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,I got banned for absolutely no reason and now I‚Äôm unable to create a new account. There‚Äôs nothing wrong or ANYTHING I could have done to get banned. Not a very good business strategy to ban customers for no reason. I‚Äôll be telling everybody I know not to use it. Absolutely ridiculous.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Crappy app I have been blocked and so are 2 other of my friends ! A guy and another woman we did nothing wrong too ! Brutal
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"i literally did nothing wrong, they refused to reactive my account. they won‚Äôt even tell me what i did to get banned."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,"I‚Äôm theory, Tinder offers dating promise. In practice, there is much to be improved with the app. First and foremost is that Tinder fails to respect a distance specification. I set my distance at 75km and yet 80+% of the potential matches presented are geographically beyond my specification. I do not want to initiate dating with someone who is more than an hour‚Äôs drive away. Sadly, Tinder doesn‚Äôt respect my wishes despite offering a ‚Äúdistance limit‚Äù setting. If you‚Äôre going to offer an option, then honour that option and don‚Äôt waste my time with outliers. 

Next in line: I live in a fairly remote area so the potential matches aren‚Äôt numerous. When I reject a potential match it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not interested. Tinder does not take the hint. Within a day, all my rejections are back on the table. Again, stop wasting my time. If you think the moron on Tuesday is going to become the man of my dreams on Wednesday, you are sorely mistaken."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Got banned for no apparent reason never got refunded and now I can‚Äôt even use the app because there is no appeal process for bans apparently. These guys are absolute crooks don‚Äôt bother with crap.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Had some girl harassing me and besides banning her I got banned for making a childish remark on my end, no block feature so I was rude. And contacted them apologizing and just letting them know she wouldn‚Äôt stop spamming and harassing me and my account gets banned, the customer service for this app is terrible,"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Stupid app and no refund for subscription extra . Scammers. That‚Äôs it
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Could you please stop showing me people 11000km away when my global setting is off?

1 star update:
And please return sent likes list feature"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Are you prepared to be underwhelmed?

 The only time you will get any likes is when you are boosted, does it cost money to purchase boosts? Of course it does!!  Unless my profile had the boost going it‚Äôs like it was invisible.   As I said to Tinder when I was deleting my account, I‚Äôm no Brad Pitt or anything, but Im not Frankenstein either.  ZERO likes unless my profile had the half hour boost activated.  Terrible. üëéüèª"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Honestly this app is great, this is new way to meet tons of people. A lot of people here complaining about not having a lot of matches or people replying is on them.

Having said that a lot of people here are complaining about being banned with no explanation.

I am also one of those people and the only prompt i have received is that i have violated terms of use which i reviewed and have not.

The only customer support they have is an automated robot which doesn‚Äôt seem to actually review your file and they don‚Äôt have a customer support number the only number i found tried scamming me.

So essentially they don‚Äôt seem to care about customers they have stated they take reports seriously (bullying, abuse) which is must‚Äôve what happened to me yet they do not check the legitimacy of the report.

Although they have not considered there are people that will report out of spite / grudge which is a form of bullying and abuse so there system is in need to be updated.

Disappointed in the zero customer service in a large company but such is life, seeing as i‚Äôm banned now for life this will be my last interaction with this business."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,I‚Äôve had so many issues with this app and I paid for it! I contacted Tinder and they told me to do everything I‚Äôve already done. Delete the app...Reload the app....log out...log back in...blah blah blah. Could see when people were online at first and then couldn‚Äôt. Kept showing that I had messages and matches that I‚Äôd already read and seen. Total Waste of money....they should fix the app and extend people‚Äôs subscriptions to make up for all the features that don‚Äôt work properly.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Bots, bots , bots. Spend money so you can see what bots are into youüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"As soon as I registered and posted pics I automatically got banned, without even swiping on anybody or communicating with anybody on the app. I sent an email to customer support to appeal but you just get bot replies linking the terms of service. I think I automatically got banned by an algorithm because I used one of those meme sticker things in the background to block my friends face and it thought it was someone using fake pics. Garbage app with garbage customer support."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Was enjoying the app actually connected with a person near by but when I went to go on again to respond to her, it said this actually has been banned, would like to know how to make a fresh account or re-activate my account? Can some one write a review on how to do that!"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Tried to sign up. Had a brain fart with other dates in my head. Accidentally made my birthdate 2015 instead of 1992. Account banned for over 4400 days. Sent off an email stating my mistake hoping to find a way around it. Nope. Got an email saying I have to be patient and wait 12 years. Oh also I got the ‚Äúthanks for understanding‚Äù line at the end. 

Absolutely garbage. I miss the good old days before you had to pay for unlimited swiping. App just gone downhill apparently."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,"Always glitching in some form or another (right now not letting me load any of my videos and making old convos appear) so not the best app although I‚Äôve met a few ppl I still talk to and have become friends with, and it‚Äôs entertaining when it works so that‚Äôs why this gets at least 2 stars"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,3,Well now everyone can tell when I‚Äôm ignoring them so that‚Äôs kinda inconvenient
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong on tinder, never msg anyone more than once and only respond when in a chat, I go to sign in and I‚Äôm banned?. For what,no reason from tinder or anything , maybe people report or block people for nothing , their looks , no profile pic or just cuz they don‚Äôt want to chat to them, people have the right to know why they are being banned , tinder has all your info even after you are banned, they could be doing stuff to your personal information. 
I would lien a reason why I got banned and if they look through my chat history they will see nothing is wrong.

If enough people report tinder for their false banning and keeping peoples information they could be shutdown or even sued.
So who ever got banned or reported for no reason and tinder kept their info and stopped them from joining again report them to App Store and I copied this review in case tinder deletes it to try to save themselves from someone who is helping other people to find out their reason"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,4,Last year this feature was so fun and since many people are locked down again it would be good. PLS
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Did nothing, just redownloaded the app after I deleted it 7 months ago, and I was already banned. I have never broken any rule, never gave any hate speech, nothing unsolicited, treated everyone with respect. I don‚Äôt understand."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,J‚Äôai supprim√© mon compte et ensuite je l‚Äôai regrett√© et j‚Äôai essay√© de revenir et j‚Äôai √©t√© banni. Pensez-y a 2 fois avant de supprimer votre compte. C‚Äôest assez ordinaire...
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Banned me for no reason lol
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,stop putting minors c supposed to be a meeting site not a daycare because of you i am banne
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Im forced to reinstall the app any time i want to see a new match or new message. Makes it unusable.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,If they cannot remove the fake profiles asking to move to snap chat and all the other fake material on the app. All I can say is I am disappointed.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Hey been banned from the app not sure what‚Äôs wrong
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Don‚Äôt bother, unless you want to lose all your connections from being banned without reason and no support to explain why but a robotic email response. Had the app for a couple years and never been warned once. Thanks for nothing."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,This app is trash. Google it.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,5,Je trouve tr√®s bon votre application üòäüòäüòä‚ù§Ô∏è
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"They don‚Äôt care about their consumers or customers in the slightest. After three days of use, I was hitting it off with someone, who turned out to likely be a bot (which is my bad sure).
However, they eventually hacked into my account and it was banned. I was a platinum member and verified as well, and they would not do anything about it. I definitely do not recommend anyone use this app."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,"My list of ‚Äúlikes me‚Äù has grown since I started using the app. But I swipe and I swipe and I never find them, and they never match me. So I know people out there have swiped right on me but the algorithm is keeping them out of my stack?

Makes no sense. If you want people to use the app there should be more matches. 

And no I‚Äôm not paying $40/month so I can see them. I don‚Äôt need to see them, but they should be accessible to me at some point."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,3,"What is this new green indicator...do you really want to add this kind of feature (recently active). It‚Äôs only good to create harassment between members when one does not reply.

I disable the option but it doesn‚Äôt seem to work since I still see this green indicator next to my matches names."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Yeah I think my Tinder is broken, it‚Äôs not respecting the age preference at all that has been said which has been a super frustrating experience, the app constantly crashes and freezes at some point, in addition to that there‚Äôs tons of fake profiles who are constantly innovating to look like the real thing right now this is just a piss poor experience and it sucks because when it actually does work it‚Äôs somewhat enjoyable to use normally I don‚Äôt write a review but this has been a constant source of frustration for me so I figured I would vent it out."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Ridden with spam, people soliciting sex-for-money, and other scams. I can spot them but their algorithms can‚Äôt. Puh-lease. Shameful corporate conduct."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,"It keeps lagging and not showing my new matches and conversations. Fix it, please?"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,My account got hacked and now I‚Äôm banned permanently. It‚Äôs clear I was if they look at it but say there‚Äôs nothing they can do. Now I have to figure out how to unsubscribe from my account without being able to sign in. Because they have no issue continuing to take my money. My auto renewal is coming up as well. It actually says with the ban that I have to do this. Ridiculous
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,"Short term fix is setting distance to a different range, then reverting to desired range. After a few swipes it goes back to showing outside my area (at least 25-50km above desired range). Kind of useless if everyone I swipe on is too far to reach..."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,"I made a second account for a friend of mine, using the same phone number I used for my first account and now I have no access to the first one at all... the email I used for that one is old and now deleted... so there‚Äôs no email associated with it however, my phone number still is

Is there any way for me to log into my first account?
(We tried deleting the second so that my number would only be associated with the first account rather than two... but it said ‚Äútrouble deleting your account try again later‚Äù) 
If there is a way to fix this please help me out."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,First it would keep changing my age settings to outside my set range. Now the ‚Äúglobal‚Äù feature no longer works. This happens after purchasing for the gold level.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"i literally just went to go check on my messages and was awakened by a random ban, i have no inappropriate photos or rude comments towards anyone, like, what is this ?üò°"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,3,Over all it‚Äôs a good app but as soon as I bought tinder gold I could no longer use tinder global. Please fix this as I‚Äôve reinstalled the app twice and it hasn‚Äôt resolved the issue.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,App is slow and laggy after being open for a few minutes and then crashes. While the app is laggy it effects the whole phone. This has only been since updating to the most recent iOS.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"It‚Äôs bad enough this app crashes as often as it does, but today I was banned without a warning or even an explanation. I was a paying member (platinum) and there is no way to appeal the ban, or get money back.  Don‚Äôt take the chance of spending money on this app as it seems many people get banned and tinder won‚Äôt explain to them why (Google search to see how common this is)."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Terrible. Wish I never started using this app it has not matched me with anyone who I‚Äôve been interested in. I‚Äôm 6‚Äù1 slim muscular build, full set of hair, full time job, nice car, own place and good looking but by using this app I have had no luck whatsoever"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"All fake profiles and nothing good about this app. Waste of time and energy and if people are spending money on this, it‚Äôs sad"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"I downloaded tinder maybe a week ago. Approx 4-5 days ago, I paid for tinder platinum. Today, I used it throughout the day, but when I went to check a reply - my account was banned. I didn‚Äôt send anything inappropriate and none of my photos were inappropriate. I‚Äôm at an absolute loss as to why I‚Äôm banned, but I do know that tinder effectively stole $30.46 from me and that I‚Äôll be contacting my credit card company to issue a chargeback.

Absolutely ridiculous to be banned with no reason listed and having broken no rules."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,This update ruined it and now it seems like every other time I swipe right it asks if I want to upgrade to a super like. What makes them think I‚Äôm gonna do it the 100th time they ask if I said no the first 99 times?
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,"I liked using the app and a lot of people are genuine. As I female I was surprised to see there weren‚Äôt a lot of dudes messaging me trying to hookup so I‚Äôm happy with my experience. I gave this a 2 star because I got banned a week ago for being underage, I sent all the documents required to prove I am in fact 18 and still, I can‚Äôt get my account. I‚Äôm super disappointed because I also paid for the app too only to get banned for a false accusation. That needs to be fixed."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Paid for platinum subscription and hadn‚Äôt even matched with anyone before my account was banned! No appeals process. Ridiculous - will be suggesting friends use other apps from now on.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,A while back i was ‚Äúbanned‚Äù on tinder. but i hadn‚Äôt used the app for months and there is no possible way to get in touch with support. Ridiculous customer support and bans are probably dealt with a bot.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Got age restricted for 744 days even though I‚Äôm over 18 and tinder support did not do anything.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,I put in my age 2002 11 27 which means I turned 18 on 2020 11 27 and the app says I need 1068 days to be able to continue because apparently I didn‚Äôt turn eighteen 18 days ago
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"After a few weeks of using it, my account was banned out of the blue without any reason or warning. I would love an explanation for this tinder. 

Thanks."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Banned for no reason and customer support is awful
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Horrible customer service. Ive been a member for quite some time until My account was taken over by some scam, the next morning I woke up and the account was banned. It‚Äôs been 14days sending regular emails to support with no response from them.

at this point I‚Äôve decided to give my money to their competitors.

Have a great day.!!!"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Tinder banned me for absolutely no reason with no explanation. This app is horrible
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"I was on tinder last night and got banned for no reason i followed by the rules
So i tried to message them to ask why was i banned 
They send me an auto message saying i cant make another account anymore.. how is it so easy to get banned on here without yall explaining why ? If i did get reported and i got banned then thats messed up."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Tinder m‚Äôoffres soit disant qu‚Äôil me propose de un rabais. Mais ce n‚Äôest vraiment pas un rabais, car un de mes chums lui avait un prix pour inf√©rieur au miens. Donc quand Tinder va vraiment me proposer un rabais. Cela me fera plaisir de vous donner une meilleure note que celle d‚Äôaujourd‚Äôhui."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Paid tinder gold and now they keep harrassing me to pay more for another type of membership. I'm supposed to be paying for an ad-free experience wth is this
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Every time I swipe right I‚Äôm asked if I‚Äôd like to upgrade it to a super like. Every. Single. Time.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Very disappointed in the way Tinder deals with customers indirectly through a submitted form. Lots of your clients are shadow-banned still paying for services they dont get! What a scam
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,So technically tinder will shadow ban for any silly reason and they will say you did what a bot thing and you won‚Äôt even notice because you can access the app and like and send messages but non of your likes will reach or your messages your whole profile is not shown to anyone even with boost super likes super boost premium don‚Äôt waste your money I thought tinder was a good app but turns out it‚Äôs the most sexist app ever toward men and the whole shadow ban thing is a new style of scamming to steal your money and keep you paying at
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,I want a free month premium trial! Please
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Trop compliqu√© ghhhhhhhhhhggtggggbbbbjjhhhhhjyhhyhhjuy
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Just found out this morning I was banned. I use the app once and a while and nothing on my profile would have violated their terms of use or community guidelines. I have not changed my profile since signing up and the conversations I‚Äôve had with people were in no way offensive. Customer service does absolutely nothing to resolve the issue even after they said they would be able to help me. Appeal forms need to be implemented because I‚Äôm clearly not the only one who has had this issue. It‚Äôs so easy for users to get other people‚Äôs accounts banned and for the most part, it‚Äôs probably a joke to begin with."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Got banned for no reason and tinder can‚Äôt tell me why.. waited 3 months for a email response on what I can do or why I was banned they avoided both questions
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Literally got banned for no apparent reason. Didn‚Äôt give me any reasoning or anything. This app is a joke, I‚Äôd download another app personally."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"I‚Äôve been trying for over a week to create a profile, and every time I get as far as uploading my pictures before they give me an error message and try again later. I‚Äôve tried... and tried again... and nothing."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,Said I violated the policy and won‚Äôt let me creat an account but just got the phone number!!! How do I fix this?
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,"So i used tinder for a long time, always have been and recently, two days ago, tried to log in the app and it said that i was banned, tried to contact them, told me there was nothing to do basically, only that i was banned and it couldnt be undone.
For the biggest dating app ever, y‚Äôall should at least help your users out with a customer service or at least a way to contact and figure out the why behind the action, i never got an email or a warning to advise me, it just banned me, so yeah thanks for all these years i guess"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"This app has become nothing more than an advertising platform for escorts and scammers.  Rarely get any matches even with a full paid account and using boosts.  The only matches I get are from scammers and escorts sending me links to sketchy websites. Don‚Äôt waste your time with this crap, plenty of other legitimate apps out there."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"The only conceivable reason I could be banned is by being falsely reported by my ex and anyone she asked to do the same, other than that I‚Äôve read through the terms and agreements and I couldn‚Äôt fathom why I‚Äôd get a ban, pretty lame on tinder‚Äôs behalf for just out right banning people without looking into the cause with either a person or better programmed AI, unban me"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,Swiping crashes the app everytime. Can‚Äôt find support for this.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Keeps sending me notifications when nothings new has changed on the app and almost every match I get is a bot
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Ya
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,From simple swiping to all these fancy features with the most recent one modifying what is now known as a ‚Äúpopular user‚Äù and urging to send a ‚Äúsuper like‚Äù which obviously shows that the platform either doesn‚Äôt care about the user experience or they are advancing to create a culture of egoistic superficials who now have the chance to get more ‚Äúsuper likes‚Äù now and therefore settle for less than ever before. Either way the results to find a real connection match is demolishing thanks to what became the joke that is tinder!
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Don‚Äôt spend any money cause you‚Äôll lose it if you get banned. Not sure what I did to get banned but woke up one day without access and no appeal process. Not impressed.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,5,Every time i try to use this app it freezes my phone and have to wait for long to slide it close. Not really recommending it right now
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,"This app is nothing but spam accounts and e girls boosting their Instagram/OF, with a sprinkle of tinder desperately trying to get you to sign up for gold. Uninstalled today for the last time"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"I did not use bad langage, I did not use bad Pictures, man I did not get to talk to anybody. One morning and It‚Äôs banned! No explanation. Nice app! (Sarcasm)"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Is someone on vacation? I mean I downloaded the app, and set everything up, started swiping and it never stopped letting me swipe. Which is great, but now there are no more profiles the feed won‚Äôt refresh and the whole thing is insanely buggy. They said they fixed it with the last update. They did not. The whole app is one giant flaw."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"This app has banned my account with no reason as to why. Someone got into my account, was scammed into giving a code thinking it was to verify them like they said, it was the first time using this app so I thought that was how you get verified. After that I tried logging in and was banned ever since. Now I can‚Äôt gain access to my account using my email or phone number. I‚Äôve heard of this happing a lot to people on this app. So I would use a different dating site other then this one. I tried reaching out to support, they just told me I violated something on the terms of use but still didn‚Äôt tell me what it was. And that nothing they could do. Very disappointed in the lack of support this app offers."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"I bought platinum, didn‚Äôt even get to send any messages and when I woke up I was banned. There is no way to appeal and I lost all the money from my subscription. They have no support line or phone number to call. Very disappointed!!!"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,"Usually this app is generally so good but I‚Äôm so upset because it‚Äôs stated glitching, I was typing a message and then it froze, then it pushed me outta the app and deleted the message I was typing, and now it‚Äôs made my match that I‚Äôd been talking to for a while and was just about to ask for the number of this morning but I can‚Äôt because I can‚Äôt find my match. This isn‚Äôt the first I‚Äôve heard of this happening though. One girl I was talking to a while back told me that she thought I‚Äôd unmatched her and stopped talking to her because she couldn‚Äôt find my profile for about a day. Idk what‚Äôs happening but it‚Äôs genuinely upsetting and I don‚Äôt know what to do."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,5,Big facts üòáüòáü•∞
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"So if you are a paid member at all times it works well. If you let your membership go, you get 1 secret admirer that you get to see a week. Only problem is that unless that person deletes their profile you should be able to see them.... well according to tech support that isn‚Äôt the case ? Now apparently someone you choose as an interest can choose to take that back? Interesting cause I don‚Äôt see that on my options but maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a guy and they already got my money."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Banned for no reason and no explanation
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"These people step on the male populous of their app by giving them BOT‚Äôs to swipe through now. Even if you‚Äôve spent money on this app they will give you bot profiles and if you deny to match wit those bots, then they pretend the whole city is clean of females. It‚Äôs a dying app that is beginning to let bots sign up basically. Sexiest towards men."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,"I relatively enjoyed using this app periodically until i was messaging this one girl talking about shoe sizes. I said ‚Äúwhat size are you, im 13‚Äù and then instantly got permanently banned from tinder for stating my shoe size. 
It said there was a way to verify my identity with id but every time i try to verify there is a bug that says oh no an error occurred. So now i just cant use tinder anymore. 

Besides this i had a pleasant experience with the app."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"My ex girlfriend seen my on tinder .. we have been broke up for 7 months 
I‚Äôm guessing she reported something false about me , abs boom.  My account gets banned. No explanation from tinder. Just banned , I‚Äôve been emailing but not getting a response !! 
Why don‚Äôt you guys get the second half of the story?? Or even try to reach out for confirmation ? 
So frustrating !!! 
Can someone get back to me !"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,I‚Äôm getting shadowbanned for I don‚Äôt know what reason.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,This app is a scam. It shows that I have zero likes but I have matches? Paid for platinum and the features don‚Äôt even work. Tried redownloading the app to see if my messages and likes would load. Nope. All my messages would disappear but the matches are still visible. Waste of time and money.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Um..  I got a scarey message from a man on Tinder.  How do I contact Tinder?  This was so weird & I am freaked out.  Call the police? Maybe.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,5,Thank you for banning my now boyfriend. If you didn‚Äôt unjustifiably ban him from this app he wouldn‚Äôt have been forced to use hinge and meet me. Thank you so much :)
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,"Hi today is my 18th birthday and my countdown to use this app is finally over. I was so excited to create my account only to find problems. When I put in my phone number I use to get a code and when I would put the code in it would just take me back to the front page to create an account or sign in. Now when I try to sign up it doesn‚Äôt even send a code. I have tried everything; waiting a few hours, reinstalling my phone and deleting and reinstalling the app but nothing changes and I still can‚Äôt create an account. Thank you"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,A didn‚Äôt violate any community guidelines and I woke up this morning with my account banned. I was just using it as a normal account and now I can‚Äôt even make a new account unless I go through the work of getting a new number and making a new Facebook account:(
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Why is my review not showing..... is it because it wasn‚Äôt great and an honest review???
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,This app is ridiculous.   There is no help from the company when it stops working.  They blame your carrier or your phone.  The app worked for two weeks and then just stopped providing an SMS code.  They will not refund me and they cannot reset my account.  I highly recommend trying a different platform.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"I have used tinder numerous times over the past couple years and for the most part have never had an issue with the app (the people on it are another story) BUT downloaded it this week and have had the following issues: 

- the same 20 or so people have showed up multiple times in the past 3 days (I‚Äôve seen several profiles at least 15x) no matter if I swipe left or right on them 
- thinking this is really glitchy I should reset, I tried to delete my account and have tried 10x to do that and each time getting a message ‚Äòthere was an error deleting your account. try again later‚Äô 
- I tried looking through the ‚Äúhelp‚Äù notes to see how to delete my account and the notes said if you find an error we probably already know about it... Umm what!? That‚Äôs the opposite of help 

This left my only option to write this review. Please fix this app so I can delete my account. Very disappointed"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,N
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Tinder needs a ban appeal system. I was banned a while back for reasons which are just absurd. Nonetheless. they no longer apply, and would like to use the app. They need to figure something out."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Tried to email them but haven‚Äôt heard back. Got banned for no reason.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,3,"I just logged on tonight and was shocked to see my account wasnt there. All matches gone. How upsetting and disappointing. I didnt delete the app at all. 

I see this has been a problem for many years lately after an internet search. Please fix this. Is there anyway to recover data?"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,3,It‚Äôs not great for actually meeting people or dating. Hinge is a much better choice because of the prompts it has to start conversations. Also I paid for tinder gold I wake up to notifications saying I have all these likes but then I open the app and there‚Äôs nothing. I had likes in the cue and one day they all disappeared. There‚Äôs definitely some bugs that need to be fixed.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Nah
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,The upgrade your like function irritates the hell out of me. You think I am not good enough for them? Okay bestie. Also this feature makes the app more like a competition for who is more popular and less of a tool to connect.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Les gens font qe Ghoster!
tinder,ca,11.29.0,5,Hey Tinder! What's the swipe left capital of North America? My guess is PDX or Regina. The whole continent could use a dose of reality. Spill the bad news beans
tinder,ca,11.29.0,3,How long have I been on rider for?????am I ugly am I not smart looking. I don‚Äôt know but this tinder thing seems like a joke
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,I don‚Äôt why I got banned on this app it‚Äôs always asking my age and I show them proof that I‚Äôm 18 yet they couldn‚Äôt recover my account.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,4,"I am enjoying Tinder and have only run into one bug and it only pertains to the ‚ÄúSecret admirer‚Äù feature, it started about four days ago when a I had a secret admirer and when I swiped right it came up with a message saying ‚Äúerror matching you with (person)‚Äù which wasn‚Äôt a problem until a dozen swipes later it happened again, same admirer but this time I swiped the other way and I can‚Äôt figure out how to move on to my next potential admirer, feedback would be appreciated, thank you in advance!"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"I had my account be completely banned with no warning or reasoning or opportunity to appeal just a reference to community guidelines. I‚Äôve sent several emails with only an automated reply in return. They will then ban your device and any account you try and create on that device. Disappointing since I was a Tinder gold subscriber.

Scammy tactics to get you to upgrade as well."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,I want a free month premium trial! Please
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Trop compliqu√© ghhhhhhhhhhggtggggbbbbjjhhhhhjyhhyhhjuy
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Just found out this morning I was banned. I use the app once and a while and nothing on my profile would have violated their terms of use or community guidelines. I have not changed my profile since signing up and the conversations I‚Äôve had with people were in no way offensive. Customer service does absolutely nothing to resolve the issue even after they said they would be able to help me. Appeal forms need to be implemented because I‚Äôm clearly not the only one who has had this issue. It‚Äôs so easy for users to get other people‚Äôs accounts banned and for the most part, it‚Äôs probably a joke to begin with."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Got banned for no reason and tinder can‚Äôt tell me why.. waited 3 months for a email response on what I can do or why I was banned they avoided both questions
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Literally got banned for no apparent reason. Didn‚Äôt give me any reasoning or anything. This app is a joke, I‚Äôd download another app personally."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"I‚Äôve been trying for over a week to create a profile, and every time I get as far as uploading my pictures before they give me an error message and try again later. I‚Äôve tried... and tried again... and nothing."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,Said I violated the policy and won‚Äôt let me creat an account but just got the phone number!!! How do I fix this?
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,"So i used tinder for a long time, always have been and recently, two days ago, tried to log in the app and it said that i was banned, tried to contact them, told me there was nothing to do basically, only that i was banned and it couldnt be undone.
For the biggest dating app ever, y‚Äôall should at least help your users out with a customer service or at least a way to contact and figure out the why behind the action, i never got an email or a warning to advise me, it just banned me, so yeah thanks for all these years i guess"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"This app has become nothing more than an advertising platform for escorts and scammers.  Rarely get any matches even with a full paid account and using boosts.  The only matches I get are from scammers and escorts sending me links to sketchy websites. Don‚Äôt waste your time with this crap, plenty of other legitimate apps out there."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"The only conceivable reason I could be banned is by being falsely reported by my ex and anyone she asked to do the same, other than that I‚Äôve read through the terms and agreements and I couldn‚Äôt fathom why I‚Äôd get a ban, pretty lame on tinder‚Äôs behalf for just out right banning people without looking into the cause with either a person or better programmed AI, unban me"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,Swiping crashes the app everytime. Can‚Äôt find support for this.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Keeps sending me notifications when nothings new has changed on the app and almost every match I get is a bot
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Ya
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,From simple swiping to all these fancy features with the most recent one modifying what is now known as a ‚Äúpopular user‚Äù and urging to send a ‚Äúsuper like‚Äù which obviously shows that the platform either doesn‚Äôt care about the user experience or they are advancing to create a culture of egoistic superficials who now have the chance to get more ‚Äúsuper likes‚Äù now and therefore settle for less than ever before. Either way the results to find a real connection match is demolishing thanks to what became the joke that is tinder!
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Don‚Äôt spend any money cause you‚Äôll lose it if you get banned. Not sure what I did to get banned but woke up one day without access and no appeal process. Not impressed.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,5,Every time i try to use this app it freezes my phone and have to wait for long to slide it close. Not really recommending it right now
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,"This app is nothing but spam accounts and e girls boosting their Instagram/OF, with a sprinkle of tinder desperately trying to get you to sign up for gold. Uninstalled today for the last time"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"I did not use bad langage, I did not use bad Pictures, man I did not get to talk to anybody. One morning and It‚Äôs banned! No explanation. Nice app! (Sarcasm)"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Is someone on vacation? I mean I downloaded the app, and set everything up, started swiping and it never stopped letting me swipe. Which is great, but now there are no more profiles the feed won‚Äôt refresh and the whole thing is insanely buggy. They said they fixed it with the last update. They did not. The whole app is one giant flaw."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"This app has banned my account with no reason as to why. Someone got into my account, was scammed into giving a code thinking it was to verify them like they said, it was the first time using this app so I thought that was how you get verified. After that I tried logging in and was banned ever since. Now I can‚Äôt gain access to my account using my email or phone number. I‚Äôve heard of this happing a lot to people on this app. So I would use a different dating site other then this one. I tried reaching out to support, they just told me I violated something on the terms of use but still didn‚Äôt tell me what it was. And that nothing they could do. Very disappointed in the lack of support this app offers."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"I bought platinum, didn‚Äôt even get to send any messages and when I woke up I was banned. There is no way to appeal and I lost all the money from my subscription. They have no support line or phone number to call. Very disappointed!!!"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,"Usually this app is generally so good but I‚Äôm so upset because it‚Äôs stated glitching, I was typing a message and then it froze, then it pushed me outta the app and deleted the message I was typing, and now it‚Äôs made my match that I‚Äôd been talking to for a while and was just about to ask for the number of this morning but I can‚Äôt because I can‚Äôt find my match. This isn‚Äôt the first I‚Äôve heard of this happening though. One girl I was talking to a while back told me that she thought I‚Äôd unmatched her and stopped talking to her because she couldn‚Äôt find my profile for about a day. Idk what‚Äôs happening but it‚Äôs genuinely upsetting and I don‚Äôt know what to do."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,5,Big facts üòáüòáü•∞
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"So if you are a paid member at all times it works well. If you let your membership go, you get 1 secret admirer that you get to see a week. Only problem is that unless that person deletes their profile you should be able to see them.... well according to tech support that isn‚Äôt the case ? Now apparently someone you choose as an interest can choose to take that back? Interesting cause I don‚Äôt see that on my options but maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a guy and they already got my money."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Banned for no reason and no explanation
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"These people step on the male populous of their app by giving them BOT‚Äôs to swipe through now. Even if you‚Äôve spent money on this app they will give you bot profiles and if you deny to match wit those bots, then they pretend the whole city is clean of females. It‚Äôs a dying app that is beginning to let bots sign up basically. Sexiest towards men."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,"I relatively enjoyed using this app periodically until i was messaging this one girl talking about shoe sizes. I said ‚Äúwhat size are you, im 13‚Äù and then instantly got permanently banned from tinder for stating my shoe size. 
It said there was a way to verify my identity with id but every time i try to verify there is a bug that says oh no an error occurred. So now i just cant use tinder anymore. 

Besides this i had a pleasant experience with the app."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"My ex girlfriend seen my on tinder .. we have been broke up for 7 months 
I‚Äôm guessing she reported something false about me , abs boom.  My account gets banned. No explanation from tinder. Just banned , I‚Äôve been emailing but not getting a response !! 
Why don‚Äôt you guys get the second half of the story?? Or even try to reach out for confirmation ? 
So frustrating !!! 
Can someone get back to me !"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,I‚Äôm getting shadowbanned for I don‚Äôt know what reason.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,This app is a scam. It shows that I have zero likes but I have matches? Paid for platinum and the features don‚Äôt even work. Tried redownloading the app to see if my messages and likes would load. Nope. All my messages would disappear but the matches are still visible. Waste of time and money.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Um..  I got a scarey message from a man on Tinder.  How do I contact Tinder?  This was so weird & I am freaked out.  Call the police? Maybe.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,5,Thank you for banning my now boyfriend. If you didn‚Äôt unjustifiably ban him from this app he wouldn‚Äôt have been forced to use hinge and meet me. Thank you so much :)
tinder,ca,11.29.0,2,"Hi today is my 18th birthday and my countdown to use this app is finally over. I was so excited to create my account only to find problems. When I put in my phone number I use to get a code and when I would put the code in it would just take me back to the front page to create an account or sign in. Now when I try to sign up it doesn‚Äôt even send a code. I have tried everything; waiting a few hours, reinstalling my phone and deleting and reinstalling the app but nothing changes and I still can‚Äôt create an account. Thank you"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,A didn‚Äôt violate any community guidelines and I woke up this morning with my account banned. I was just using it as a normal account and now I can‚Äôt even make a new account unless I go through the work of getting a new number and making a new Facebook account:(
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Why is my review not showing..... is it because it wasn‚Äôt great and an honest review???
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,This app is ridiculous.   There is no help from the company when it stops working.  They blame your carrier or your phone.  The app worked for two weeks and then just stopped providing an SMS code.  They will not refund me and they cannot reset my account.  I highly recommend trying a different platform.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"I have used tinder numerous times over the past couple years and for the most part have never had an issue with the app (the people on it are another story) BUT downloaded it this week and have had the following issues: 

- the same 20 or so people have showed up multiple times in the past 3 days (I‚Äôve seen several profiles at least 15x) no matter if I swipe left or right on them 
- thinking this is really glitchy I should reset, I tried to delete my account and have tried 10x to do that and each time getting a message ‚Äòthere was an error deleting your account. try again later‚Äô 
- I tried looking through the ‚Äúhelp‚Äù notes to see how to delete my account and the notes said if you find an error we probably already know about it... Umm what!? That‚Äôs the opposite of help 

This left my only option to write this review. Please fix this app so I can delete my account. Very disappointed"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,N
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,"Tinder needs a ban appeal system. I was banned a while back for reasons which are just absurd. Nonetheless. they no longer apply, and would like to use the app. They need to figure something out."
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Tried to email them but haven‚Äôt heard back. Got banned for no reason.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,3,"I just logged on tonight and was shocked to see my account wasnt there. All matches gone. How upsetting and disappointing. I didnt delete the app at all. 

I see this has been a problem for many years lately after an internet search. Please fix this. Is there anyway to recover data?"
tinder,ca,11.29.0,3,It‚Äôs not great for actually meeting people or dating. Hinge is a much better choice because of the prompts it has to start conversations. Also I paid for tinder gold I wake up to notifications saying I have all these likes but then I open the app and there‚Äôs nothing. I had likes in the cue and one day they all disappeared. There‚Äôs definitely some bugs that need to be fixed.
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,Nah
tinder,ca,11.29.0,1,The upgrade your like function irritates the hell out of me. You think I am not good enough for them? Okay bestie. Also this feature makes the app more like a competition for who is more popular and less of a tool to connect.

tinder,nz,12.2.0,1,"I had recently paid for a 6 month membership and they took my account away from me keeping the money with no explanation as to why they had done so and no appeal was allowed. 
Confused I emailed them to gather more of an understanding and was fronted an emotionless email saying that I can‚Äôt appeal and they are keeping the money. 

no compassion and over all bad service."
tinder,nz,12.1.0,2,Well I would like it if I actually got matches without having to fork out a ridiculous amount for gold.... it‚Äôs way way to expensive and not even worth it!
tinder,nz,12.1.0,1,"It‚Äôs unfair that I can‚Äôt use this app due to ex‚Äôs, soon as they see me they report. Even if I havnt broken any rules, I blur out photos of anyone in my photos, I stick to guidelines and follow rules but constantly get banned I pay money to use this and will stop unless something happens, won‚Äôt recommend to anyone with ex‚Äôs"
tinder,nz,12.1.0,1,They are stealing your info and instantly banning you. When you ask to have your data deleted they refuse.
tinder,nz,12.1.0,1,"I‚Äôve never written a review before but I feel I need to. This is the glitchiest app I‚Äôve ever used, it always freezes, or takes so long to move to the next screen. After you swipe someone right who has already matched with you it takes like 10 seconds for it to pop up so you can continue to use this app. Please fix"
tinder,nz,12.1.0,2,"I went to go on tinder and it has come up with mandatory conditions I have to agree to so as to continue using the app but the conditions are things such as ‚ÄúI consent to the (mandatory) transfer of my personal information outside South Korea‚Äù and when I go to read the details, it is all written in Korean. Now this wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be a probably except I live in New Zealand where we speak English and I have my app set to English so I‚Äôm just very confused as to why I have to agree to this and why it won‚Äôt let me change the language to English so I can read what the hell I mandatorily have to agree to."
tinder,nz,12.1.0,1,"Mandatory consent to the collection, use and transfer of my personal information seems dodgy. Not to mention when I click the link to read for details about what I am consenting to, the information is in a language I cannot understand, and am unable to change."
tinder,nz,12.1.0,1,"I got banned for no reason, with no warning, emailed to get an explanation they wouldn‚Äôt tell me and they do not allow reviews of bans ( which is a life ban) was a great app until this point but would like to at least find out why I‚Äôm banned"
tinder,nz,11.31.0,1,"I never posted anything inappropriate, I‚Äôd had the app only a couple of days, had max three conversations that went more than two messages, and none of that was inappropriate or against any guidelines. No place to review the decision, no explanation of what happened either."
tinder,nz,11.31.0,1,I started off getting lots of matches years ago when the app was great. Met lots of girls off here back then. Now the app has changed to a ‚Äúpay to match‚Äù system and in recent years I was getting hardly any matches at all. Been a gold subscriber for years then suddenly banned for no reason. I never had anything offensive on my bio or talked to any girls rudely. What was once a great way to meet girls is now an absolute scam. The developers should be ashamed of themselves for what Tinder has now become.
tinder,nz,11.31.0,1,I would actually give zero stars but there may still be honest people using this app. Please be aware of people on this site as they are scammers. Do a reverse image search which can easily be found in google. I matched and we talked for ages but then he started dodging really easy questions about his profession. This triggered something for me so I did a reverse image search and found a whole website about his scam. They may say they are within your area but they are not. Please stay safe.
tinder,nz,11.31.0,1,"Title says it all. As do many other people speaking about the same problem. Nothing rude was said, no disrespect to anyone, followed their guidelines and rules-yet... bam... banned for no reason. If they were to give reasons, people might know where it went wrong, but that would mean tinder‚Äôs confession to so many muck ups on their part."
tinder,nz,11.31.0,4,Many overseas users post fake profiles and pics. They lie and try to get money out of people. It‚Äôs quite distressing to be subjected to this behaviour.
tinder,nz,11.31.0,1,"Got banned for nothing ü§© deleted the app whilst I was w my SO n redownloaded after breakup,had the account for 1 day, hadn‚Äôt talked to anyone, just swiped. No warnings, nothing. Will put money on jealous ex n his mates and there‚Äôs no appeal process. Super trash"
tinder,nz,11.31.0,1,You made it so lame. Boo.
tinder,nz,11.31.0,1,For some reason I‚Äôve been banned from Tinder with no reasoning or explanations from them. I‚Äôve never been to rude to anyone that I‚Äôve matched with & have filed appeals multiple times with no luck.
tinder,nz,11.31.0,3,Good app but tinder the attitude of the male Bugs  these days is not appealing to me an the other female counterparts! I think you need to fix the bugs x then I actually think if you do fix that you!! The app will be top app for 2021.. Chur :))

tinder,nz,11.30.0,1,Been using tinder for 3 years and been purchasing the gold ticket every month ! Been an absolute loyal customer and just purchased gold ticket 2 days ago again and my account got banned !!! For no idea what reasons ... this is ridiculous !!!! All my matches gone ! All the communications ! Not only that my money that I paid for gold ticket and used it 4 days is gone as well... that is fraud
tinder,nz,11.30.0,1,"I have been banned as have 2 of my friends, watch out no refund and no appeals waste of money."
tinder,nz,11.30.0,1,"Tinder‚Äôs many attempts to upswell your subscription is making this app experience pesky and a nuisance to use.

Tinder girls have a gift for not responding to messages this is unlike the girls on bumble who often continue a steady conversation.

bumble is obviously doing something better or attracting better people"
tinder,nz,11.30.0,1,Hate this app. Just the fact people don‚Äôt have to state where they are located means so much time wasted. Saw with lack of profile information.

tinder,nz,11.30.0,1,I literally keep on getting banned for no reason and without any explanation this is the worst app ever it‚Äôs honestly so ridiculous I just downloaded bumble instead bc tinder is hopeless
tinder,nz,11.30.0,1,Why don‚Äôt I get matches and why can‚Äôt I delete my account?
tinder,nz,11.30.0,1,"I have been banned for absolutely no reason, obviously from people reporting me. I have not broken any rules. Tinder will NOT restore my account or unban me. Such a letdown and waste of time"
tinder,nz,11.30.0,1,Got banned for absolutely no reason. I‚Äôve read the terms of use and have not gone against any of the rules. Asked for a reason why I was banned and they didn‚Äôt bother to give one.
tinder,nz,11.30.0,1,Can‚Äôt select the region of photo you want. Can‚Äôt select the whole photo. Stupid selector just goes back to default position. Always fighting bugs with the really poor modern UI.
tinder,nz,11.30.0,1,Hi guys I got banned from my account just now. I honestly don‚Äôt know what I done wrong. I‚Äôm pretty good and respectful too others on the app. Could you please sort this out as I think it‚Äôs not unfair what just happen. üôÅüôÅ
tinder,nz,11.30.0,1,And there‚Äôs no way to tell tinder which account to show üò¢
tinder,nz,11.29.0,1,I turned team tinder notifications off and I still get them about them trying to sell tinder plus. We all know there‚Äôs no point paying for this...
tinder,nz,11.29.0,1,"Very buggy, problems with messages not sending/duplicating/disappearing. Constantly showing profiles well outside of both the maximum set distance and set age limit which is extremely annoying. Also keeps bringing profiles up that have already been swiped left for many times."
tinder,nz,11.29.0,1,You get blocked on here for no reason
tinder,nz,11.29.0,1,"Okay I‚Äôve been holding off on this one for ages hoping minor bugs would be fixed yet here we are.

1) I have 19 notifications that I can‚Äôt clear because there is nothing
2) people from 100+ kms away from my discovery range keep seeing my profile when I‚Äôve set it 15km 
3) old matches I‚Äôve deleted or unmatched from years or months ago are still in my tinder. I delete them again and then they pop back up. 

ALSO please for all the people that have mad anxiety and self esteem issues PLEASE REMOVE THE ONLINE STATUS FROM OUR MATCHES... it‚Äôs already bad enough getting ghosted... I don‚Äôt need a little green circle to confirm it."
tinder,nz,11.29.0,1,Got banned for absolutely no reason at all. Would really appreciate if my account was unbanned
tinder,nz,11.29.0,3,It‚Äôs fine Thanks although might need a few updates because it can be slow at times but other then that I have no issues with the app
tinder,nz,11.28.0,1,The new update refuses to let me read messages and I have uninstalled and reinstalled numerous times.
tinder,nz,11.28.0,1,"Banned for no reason, no explanation or warning either just BANNED"
tinder,nz,11.28.0,1,can‚Äôt read messages that my matches have sent you can see it but when you click on it it only shows the first message sent
tinder,nz,11.28.0,1,Each update seems to introduce new annoying pop-ups or ads. Just had an ad in the chats screen.
tinder,nz,11.28.0,1,"Tinder banned my account for no reason... I had an account a while back and deleted it when I met someone I then tried to make a new one and it says that my account has been banned, even though I haven‚Äôt done anything that violates the community guidelines..."
tinder,nz,11.28.0,1,"Every message that I send it doesn‚Äôt appear   
Or any message that my matches send me doesn‚Äôt appear either. 
What‚Äôs going on????"
tinder,nz,11.27.0,1,If your a guy it‚Äôs really hard not to get banned or if your face is slightly turned u can‚Äôt post it yet ya can hardly even see any of the girls faces I got banned for the dumbest reasons and that was my goat in the background and apparently it‚Äôs animals cruelty and the dumbest thing is ya can‚Äôt be unbanned once banned ya banned for life
tinder,nz,11.27.0,1,Gave me no reason why or warning I don‚Äôt get it honestly so glad I never bought premium
tinder,nz,11.27.0,1,Lost previous matches and people I was talking to
tinder,nz,11.27.0,1,"I‚Äôve seriously messed up my elo score. Don‚Äôt pretend it‚Äôs not a real thing address it. Not realising what I was doing, I was once swiping right 100% of the time and now I‚Äôm being punished for it. My profile isn‚Äôt shown to barely anyone. Every time I go on the app It brings down my confidence since I never match with the girls I like. Am I actually shown to them? Or am I just so your app can notify ‚Äúsomeone likes you‚Äù on their phone with no intention to EVER match us. I‚Äôve paid my dues please fix your algorithm because this app has stopped showing me any love. My potential matches stays stagnant at 35 and never increases. Your app is knocking my self confidence and mental health because you don‚Äôt give an equal opportunity to your users. Something for consideration."
tinder,nz,11.26.1,1,"For what? No warning, nothing? Don‚Äôt even know what it was for.......... glad I didn‚Äôt spend any money on this app would rather turn gay and use Grindr üíã"
tinder,nz,11.26.1,1,"Well 
It seems this app has had its time trying lives but for my eyes I spot no different
And for my heart less Imamate! This app provides no different. At lest no redirect."
tinder,nz,11.26.1,1,‚ÄúPesky Bug fixes‚Äù was being able to like more than 10 people in a 12 hour period a bug? I think everyone using the app would agree that it‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt. Piss poor performance from tinder for constantly dropping the amount of ‚Äúlikes‚Äù you get
tinder,nz,11.26.0,1,I got banned for telling a story mentioning I was 14
tinder,nz,11.26.0,1,Getting messages and can‚Äôt see them unless I delete the app and then reinstall waste of time
tinder,nz,11.26.0,1,Get notifications for new messages but I can‚Äôt see them unless I delete the app and re-add it. Always dropping out also. Can‚Äôt get in contact with anybody re this issue. Annoying.
tinder,nz,11.25.0,1,I tried to create an account with a sim that has never had tinder and it said it was banned? How is that even possible? It‚Äôs just frustrating
tinder,nz,11.25.0,3,Got banned for no reason Kinda disappointed considering a lot people seem to be getting banned for no reason
tinder,nz,11.25.0,1,The app isn‚Äôt working as I am getting other users that are outside my age and distance preferences. The customer service team is not responding and not helping with this query which is disappointing. I have done all the things they suggested but none of it is working. It‚Äôs also terrible that their FAQs page has simple fixes to issues that don‚Äôt work.
tinder,nz,11.24.1,1,I literally made my tinder account and I had it for three days before it got banned. I never said anything inappropriate to anyone and my bio and picture were all mines and respectful as well. You guys need to sort this out!!!!!!!!!!!
tinder,nz,11.24.1,2,"So regardless of getting matches or not, I have seen that I have about 40 matches that I cannot see unless I get gold. I literally went on a spree and liked everyone in an default radios because ‚Äúif that happens, then I‚Äôll see those 40 and choose for myself whether or not I like them‚Äù. I literally get through everyone and I didn‚Äôt match with 40 people. It was more like 10. If I went though everyone in my area then how do I only get 10 likes back? I‚Äôm not global, so how does that happen. Tbh at the end of the day, this is false advertising for the gold status. Maybe make an accurate score of how many people like you back based on active users rather than those who have either deleted their accounts or are inactive. Again, it‚Äôs false advertising, if I want to buy gold to see those people, maybe make sure they‚Äôre actually real people. Work this out in your algorithm please. Moreover, I‚Äôm not interested in global but if a person likes me back from 10k away good for them, but I don‚Äôt want that."
tinder,nz,11.24.0,1,Banned for no apparent reason. This needs to be fixed ASAP on behalf of all the lads that have stuck within your guidelines and still got pinged. Gummon..
tinder,nz,11.24.0,1,Worst app to use. I was banned for no reason and wasn‚Äôt told why. Contacted them for then to say you'll stay banned and still wouldn‚Äôt tell me why?
tinder,nz,11.24.0,1,I thought that when paying for it it was $8+ a month not $50+ all at once is there anyway I can get someone to email about this
tinder,nz,11.24.0,1,It lags and takes so long to load one thing. It‚Äôs only this app that does this
tinder,nz,11.23.0,3,I have lost all my matches
tinder,nz,11.23.0,1,"I can‚Äôt even message my matches because the enable push notifications alert takes up half the screen in any chat. 
I don‚Äôt want push notifications on I don‚Äôt want people seeing my phone and seeing I have messages or matches popping up 
It‚Äôs enough to make me stop using the app. Fix this it‚Äôs annoying af"
tinder,nz,11.23.0,1,Banned for no reason. Had the app/same account for over 2 years and get a message saying my age verification can‚Äôt be complete (I am 20) then try to log in again and it says i‚Äôm banned. Just purchased tinder plus as well.
tinder,nz,11.23.0,1,Boost doesnt work wasted 20$
tinder,nz,11.23.0,1,"Around 50% fake profiles, scammers trying to cheat you (location dependent). Sometimes another 25% hookers. Makes it hard to use. Zero customer service - I mean zero. There is no way to contact this company."
tinder,nz,11.23.0,1,"I signed up and swiped through about 5 profiles and it‚Äôs been searching for new profiles since. 

There are clearly other profiles out there so I‚Äôm not really sure what‚Äôs going on üòï"
tinder,nz,11.22.0,1,Got banned for no reason and won‚Äôt get unbanned. First time I got banned because I get hacked and that someone got me banned. Second time I was joking in my bio that I‚Äôm 14. Ridiculous!
tinder,nz,11.22.0,1,"I have subscriebed to tinder plus, neither of tinder plus features are working. It says can rewind and reswipe, i can't do that. The passport to swipe around the world doesn't work."
tinder,nz,11.22.0,5,"This app is what lead me to Archie, Archie is my soul mate. Archie is the dog that was at my mates tinder date. How good"
tinder,nz,11.21.0,1,"Would be good to add a feature where you can sort matches by distance  
And have a way to appeal bans I was banned without notice, no explanation as to why and no way to appeal would of thought considering I pay for tinder plus I‚Äôd at least get an explanation"
tinder,nz,11.21.0,1,The support team are terrible
tinder,nz,11.21.0,1,"I guess this app is coming to the end of its life cycle, if you‚Äôre trying to use this in New Zealand beware there is an abundance of fake accounts and it doesn‚Äôt seem like the developer is doing anything to combat this which is a pity üòû and it‚Äôs definitely not worth the subscription fee!"
tinder,nz,11.21.0,1,Downloaded tinder wouldnt search for anyone couldnt msg anyone i matched then randomly got banned ggs
tinder,nz,11.20.0,1,I used to be able to see a secret admirer for free every now and then but now when I click one it doesn‚Äôt work and just says better luck next time and doesn‚Äôt show me anyone üòï
tinder,nz,11.20.0,1,"Despite the age and distance parameters I set in settings, I continually have potential matches popping up that fit neither the age range I‚Äôm interested in, nor the distance.  Really annoying!"
tinder,nz,11.19.0,1,Can I be unbanned now please I didn‚Äôt do anything ?
tinder,nz,11.18.0,1,"keeps glitching, wont show new matches, or any potential and won‚Äôt let me access messages. update"
tinder,nz,11.18.0,1,It said 17+ on the App Store and when I used this with my phone number and birthdate it said I had to be 18. I wish it stated this before I downloaded it
tinder,nz,11.18.0,1,What an absolute rip off! I deleted the app when I saw how much they charge. If tinder was reasonable I would use their app.
tinder,nz,11.18.0,1,"I was banned for no reason, and when i reached out about it i got no response. it‚Äôs really frustrating and i‚Äôm unable to make a new account"
tinder,nz,11.17.0,1,Accidentally put in the wrong age now I gotta wait 58 days till I can use the app
tinder,nz,11.17.0,1,I just subscribed to tinder + and changed to gold right away and it said upgrading charges 5$ for each month and I bought it gold and my 79.99$ and 139.99$ are gone it should  only spend only 139.99$ but I just spend my 219.98$ give me back my 79.99$ please reply my review
tinder,nz,11.17.0,5,"Dear Tinder thank you for being an operational application that brings people together. Because of your app I met my boyfriend and we couldn‚Äôt be happier with our life together. You brought us together and without you we may have met another way but it wouldn‚Äôt have been the same, so we just wanted to thank you.  You changed our lives. Xo."
tinder,nz,11.16.0,1,"No reason, just got deleted ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 

I would accept it if there was a justification behind the reason. Just poor coms from a company that makes its fortune from playing off being the middle person between people."
tinder,nz,11.14.0,1,Too many fake accounts on here and no on ever messages back. Match them and that‚Äôs it waste of time app if people don‚Äôt use it to reply.
tinder,nz,11.14.0,1,The meat market where a small number of insecure girls seek validation from a much larger pool of desperate and lonely men. Stay away if you value your emotional health
tinder,nz,11.14.0,1,"App launches and within about 5 seconds of the logo loading screen, it shuts down"
tinder,nz,11.14.0,1,"I think this is no dating app!! This only for s*x and paid nude photos! Tinder is not taking action on this nonsense! There are so many fake account they are sharing their Snapchat Id for this things!

tinder,nz,11.13.0,1,"So I got this tinder plus just for using location passport, it says u can locate anywhere around the world, but actually no, u can just change your location within China, other countries‚Äô city, just loading all the time. Donno if it‚Äôs just for user in China or what, anyway really disappointed."
tinder,nz,11.13.0,1,I normally get 2000+ average right swipes and now only like 500 .

the app is flooded with fake accounts and bots ...more often then real accounts 

The purchase of anything will result in an instant ban without explanation or customer support (obviously a scam)

Please fix...your app is dead"
tinder,nz,11.12.0,1,"The app is pretty much useless now, get rid of it."
tinder,nz,11.12.0,1,Absolute joke of a app and a waste of time don‚Äôt bother you will be disappointed
tinder,nz,11.12.0,1,"Tinder boost is a complete and total utter waste of money , do not do it."
tinder,nz,11.12.0,1,I but the location around me and it‚Äôs giving me people Thousands km a way that so unwanted
tinder,nz,11.11.1,1,I‚Äôve had the app for a while and just recently i noticed that tinder won‚Äôt let me post pictures in a bikini. But i see a lot of pictures of guys topless. If i try to post a bikini photo it says ‚Äúerror occurred‚Äù but any other photos works fine.
tinder,nz,11.11.1,1,My accounts been deleted after I updated it
tinder,nz,11.11.1,1,"Paid for Tinder got a lot of matches, but when I cancelled my Tinder Gold, suddenly no more matches and then when the paid period ran out I got banned. WTF?!"
tinder,nz,11.11.1,1,Really bad.   Cancel people account for nothing. That really bad. Really disappointed and really sad
tinder,nz,11.10.4,1,I can‚Äôt add any photos. I keep getting an error that they‚Äôre all too big. The app didn‚Äôt used to do this.
tinder,nz,11.10.4,1,"No in house support contact. Articles are useless. I have a current glitch to report with iPhone and it‚Äôs just round in circles. Constantly closing and reopening app, notifications are on but always has a banner to say they‚Äôre not. I think everyone should rate 1 star to have the app removed"
tinder,nz,11.10.3,1,"Won‚Äôt let me match with the ‚Äòlike‚Äô profiles
Won‚Äôt let me swipe left up or right normally
Won‚Äôt let me message any of the people I have matched with!"
tinder,nz,11.9.0,1,"Surely it can‚Äôt be that hard to block some of these spam accounts ?? They all write the same bio !!

Update - the still charge for a premium service yet the spam is worse than ever. And again.  It‚Äôs the same bio !!!!! üò°"
tinder,nz,11.9.0,2,Puede estar mejor no me gusta hay que pagar para casi todo y aparte de eso no puedo buscar pa√≠ses.
tinder,nz,11.9.0,1,Tinder is worst dating app. They just steal your money and shadow banned you. I matched with my co-worker and she said she didn‚Äôt even see my message on tinder
tinder,nz,11.9.0,1,Please un ban me
tinder,nz,11.8.0,2,There should be an IQ test for people to see if they can match each other‚Äôs IQ level at some point coz I just keep finding people who sometimes make no sense when they talk..!!!
tinder,nz,11.8.0,1,"For some reason even though I delete my account and the app, it still takes money out of my account every month. I‚Äôm really confused and upset(I know it‚Äôs only $25 dollars) but it adds up after a while. I‚Äôm just hoping I can get it back lol"
tinder,nz,11.6.1,1,Registered yet and waiting for tryout response
tinder,nz,11.6.1,2,"Nothing is more frustrating than scrolling through unopened matches and you click on one, but after you‚Äôre done looking at their profile it resets back to the start of your most recent matches. Can this please be changed? If I wanted to look at my most recent matches I wouldn‚Äôt be scrolling all the way to the end. Also there‚Äôs a bug where clicking on someone‚Äôs profile doesn‚Äôt get rid of the red dot on their profile so you have to click into their photos to get rid of it. When these come together it is honestly beyond frustrating. Over all decent app but this is the one thing I cannot stand"
tinder,nz,11.6.0,1,How do I get a refund for super likes? 50% of the profiles on Tinder are fake. It is very misleading and actually rather unhealthy to the dating community to see so many fake profiles on here. Surely the hugely profitable company can better protect us?
tinder,nz,11.6.0,3,When creating an account I entered wrong date of birth that said I was under 18 now it won‚Äôt let me re download to create an account. What do I do???
tinder,nz,11.6.0,1,Not inclusive and makes this super tricky for trans and nb folk
tinder,nz,11.5.0,1,"Paid money for tinder gold, it‚Äôs just crashes constantly and not worth the purchase. Notifications don‚Äôt work and lags way to much. App just not working at all. PLEASE FIX !!"
tinder,nz,11.5.0,4,Good app always a bit of fun. Should add night mode for night browsing
tinder,nz,11.4.0,2,"I used tinder in the past and it always seems to bug out. I can‚Äôt even make a profile, it keeps saying ‚Äúerror try agin later‚Äù. Had similar issues like this in the past."
tinder,nz,11.4.0,3,"Couldn‚Äôt figure out how to change my anthem, so tried to click on it in the edit settings, disconnected itself and now it won‚Äôt give me the option to add anthem. Have the latest update too."
tinder,nz,11.3.0,1,"Terrible app, glitchy all the time. Chat messages are slow. Nothing on bumble."
tinder,nz,11.3.0,1,"This is one of the many things in life that disappoint you once you spend your hard earned money on it. The app has biweekly problems that make it unusable, couple this with the modern female society feeling the entitlement to never message back or ignore you completely and you have a pit for lonely young men to fall into and drain their self esteem to the absolute lowest. This app is the epitome of hot garbage and you will have more success with a cardboard sign and a stakeout on a street corner."
tinder,nz,11.2.1,2,"Have never run out of people to search through.

App gets updated.

Apparently all the females within a 30km radius of me have been wiped from the face of the planet.

Don‚Äôt fix the parts that aren‚Äôt broken!"
tinder,nz,11.2.1,1,Banned me for no reason
tinder,nz,11.1.1,1,I just downloaded the app today and everytime I try log in or anything nothing shows up on the discovery. I‚Äôve changed the settings and reinstalled it twice and it‚Äôs still not working.
tinder,nz,11.1.1,1,"If the party is from overseas, good looking and asking you to give your number please do some due deligence like if he or she says they have business look them up on website or on LinkedIn and challenge then if you cannot find them
As soon as anything says about money please block and report asap"
tinder,nz,11.1.0,1,"I logged onto tinder to find it had upgraded to gold, but I didn‚Äôt actually ask for this. I can‚Äôt find anyway to undo this without continuing for a month, and there is no one from the company or Apple to easily discuss this issue with.

Is there a way this can be resolved, because I did not ask for this upgrade! I have had tinder gold in the past, and I really don‚Äôt want it again!!!"
tinder,nz,11.1.0,2,"I have been using this app for years (yes my dating life is a little tragic), out of no where my account is banned and the people at tinder won‚Äôt give me a reason why. I have read the terms and conditions of use and can‚Äôt find any violation that would of been on my account. Won‚Äôt be using this again"
tinder,nz,11.0.2,5,"A great app. I deleted the app a few months ago because I met someone, it didn‚Äôt last too long but now that I‚Äôve returned, I‚Äôm surprised to see that I am banned. I‚Äôm a decent guy and all I asked Tinder is to let me know why, or to please reinstate my account so that I can make use of it. I‚Äôve tried other apps and to be honest, Tinder is the best one out there."
tinder,nz,11.0.1,1,"I got banned and I have no idea why.
Emailed tinder for a reason and they would not give me one!
What a joke"
tinder,nz,11.0.1,2,My new likes have suddenly gone away :( why oh why?
tinder,nz,11.0.1,1,"My experience on the app was awful, and the supposed support team is non-existent. Would not recommend this app to anyone. The platform promotes a terrible mindset and perception of women, I've never been so grossed out. My safety was not even a thought for the developers."
tinder,nz,11.0.0,1,"Hi Tinder.
You are hard to get hold of, I have not had tinder for at least 4 months and a tinder gold payment has gone through without my knowledge. How is this?"
tinder,nz,10.20.0,1,"Why on my iPhone 5s it keeps on crashing each and every time I try to open it 
To open it I have to reinstall every time"
tinder,nz,10.19.1,1,"Hey devs, 
You need to work harder cuz your app crashes quite often. Now it is crashing on splash screen. Chat has so many bugs that it feels like it was built by few iOS dev beginners. Not sure for what‚Äôs your business priorities on the roadmap but you definitely need to spend huge amounts of time on fixing all this mess. Good luck"
tinder,nz,10.19.0,1,Awful site. They delete your matches as your messaging one another so they can get you to buy their premium. What a sham. Not using it again.
tinder,nz,10.18.0,3,It‚Äôs cool you can add your fav spotify + your instagram. But it would be better if you could select 5 of your 20 top artists or something. Would also be cool if it grabbed the first photo from instagram multi posts - as at the moment it grabs none from a multi post.
tinder,nz,10.18.0,1,Got banned within 5 mins of making account - didn‚Äôt even have time to write a bio ??? Emailed customer service for advice and answer and never got a nice or helpful response. I was banded for no reason and now I cannot make a new account and there is no help or apology or anything from Tinder
tinder,nz,10.18.0,2,"Not really at all, there just a lot of lookers who do not want to engage."
tinder,nz,10.18.0,5,Aman198
tinder,nz,10.18.0,5,I mean let‚Äôs be honest overall it‚Äôs pretty grim in here but then BOOM Ziggy Stardust pops up.
tinder,nz,10.18.0,1,"It‚Äôs been over a year and I still have had no explanation of why I was banned. Presumably it‚Äôs because even the staff don‚Äôt keep track of their own flawed system. I really wish they would at least do a reset or something of the banned accounts to start everyone fresh because so many people have been banned for no reason at all. But I doubt it will ever happen, since they don‚Äôt actually care, they just want to make money. Which is fair enough because they‚Äôre a business after all but I mean when you have a large chunk of people who can‚Äôt access your product for a reason that is the company‚Äôs fault, we‚Äôll surely they‚Äôd want to start again"
tinder,nz,10.18.0,2,Too many bots and this is pretty much pay to match.
tinder,nz,10.17.0,1,"50$ for a month?
180$ for 6 months üòÇ
God you dont want to know what a year costs.
Cant even see who like my profile without paying.. yeah no thanks!"
tinder,nz,10.17.0,5,Amazing
tinder,nz,10.17.0,1,I find tinder a bit of a waste of time half the time you match with someone and you never hear from them but thats not the fault if tinder it is human nature
tinder,nz,10.17.0,5,Recommend it for those who are looking for girlfriends if your a guy that is haha
tinder,nz,10.17.0,1,Hurts my feelings ‚òπÔ∏è
tinder,nz,10.17.0,5,Just got on here and it‚Äôs awesome people like me just Wana have fun and it‚Äôs safe
tinder,nz,10.17.0,3,"Far too many catfish, how can so many get through your systems (if you even have a system).
I match daily with fake accounts 16,000km away, report every one."
tinder,nz,10.17.0,1,Keeps popping up begging for a review.. stupid
tinder,nz,10.17.0,3,Cost are ridiculous. And don‚Äôt get much swipes either. Tinder‚Äôs not that attractive to users anymore.
tinder,nz,10.17.0,1,"It‚Äôs been literally more than a year after I stopped use Tinder, but yesterday I found out that somehow all this time I have been subscribed both to Tinder Plus and Tinder Gold which I didn‚Äôt subscribe for sure. For this year I lost about 400 NZD and I am really, REALLY upset. I don‚Äôt believe that I will get response from company nor I believe that they will pay attention to what happened, but people should know it might happened and their accounts that are no longer used might still be used as wallets and one you might find that you lost money.

Won‚Äôt recommend anyone."
tinder,nz,10.17.0,1,$25 a month is far to expensive for a dating app and you cant see who liked your profile without paying the $25 i think the app should be alot more cheaper than this soo i rate the app a ‚≠êÔ∏è this is stupid instantly getting deleted
tinder,nz,10.17.0,3,Yeah
tinder,nz,10.17.0,1,Average
tinder,nz,10.17.0,1,"Tinder is full of spam. Its full or can girls trying to steal men‚Äôs credit card details. Full of girls scamming men. There are girls that ask you for money by asking for gas money, and then they ask you for your bank account details. Then there are ones that ask you and match you only because they are interested in getting drugs. In fact, the majority of women on tinder are only interested in a relationship or a hook up. It‚Äôs a complete waste on time and full of time wasters or time killers.  Furthermore,  a massive majority of women that have matched me lately do not even reply!! What‚Äôs the point in even trying?"
tinder,nz,10.17.0,2,"To expensive, just like everything in New Zealand."
tinder,nz,10.17.0,3,"Find it annoying where I‚Äôm matching with someone who lives miles away. Need a location. 
& also a panic button for when you swipe the wrong way & wanna take it back. 
If you halve the price you would get more than twice as many signing in!  Too expensive for the amount of Men in my area... bigger centres would have more to choose from."
tinder,nz,10.17.0,1,A very very ‚Äòaverage ‚Äò site. There are as many fakes/scammers as there are real people. After awhile the fakes are pretty easy to pick
tinder,nz,10.17.0,2,The free version is too limited and the full version too pricey.
tinder,nz,10.17.0,1,I hate this app so much life wasn‚Äôt meant to be like this. God help us all
tinder,nz,10.17.0,1,App runs so slow and continually crashes. Very annoying. Would give less stars if I could
tinder,nz,10.17.0,2,"My opinion about Tinder is, Tinder is a very fast way to like someone on the appearance of the person that helps with the chemistry and then the character of the person when you read the profile I feel it is very fast. As long as people are honest and what they write is a great way to meet people quickly. My son met his wife on here and now they have a child still together very happy that‚Äôs a great story I feel"
tinder,nz,10.17.0,2,Disappointing
tinder,nz,10.17.0,2,To much spam
tinder,nz,10.17.0,1,"Need to have a swipe down for fakes so everyone doesn‚Äôt have to go through the drudgery of seeing fakes about 10% of the time. Make it easier for them to be faked out. I appreciated false negative issue, but would be easy to introduce staged automation to eliminate fakes that are obvious to humans."
tinder,nz,10.17.0,5,Love thanks
tinder,nz,10.17.0,1,So many fake profiles...
tinder,nz,10.17.0,4,"Add a feature where you can search your matches in your area, so if your someone who travels around a lot and has lots of matches I can then just search who I have already matched with in that area based on km away."
tinder,nz,10.16.0,1,"Tried logging in the other day and came with a message saying account banned for no reason. Bumble is way better, use that rather then Tinder. More safer and less scammers"
tinder,nz,10.16.0,1,I have my distance on 50k but can still see people 100-400k away. This is annoying. Tinder should sort this out asap
tinder,nz,10.16.0,2,Far to many fake profiles
tinder,nz,10.15.1,1,"Made an account last night and went on, only to have swipes repeat. I‚Äôm running an recently new iPhone X so there should be no application problems like this. This morning I found myself banned without warning (which is fine) but I was unable to know why I was banned or make a new account. I couldn‚Äôt figure out what I could have possibly done to be banned? I mentioned my autism, my Instagram account and how I made the ‚Äúanthem‚Äù on my profile. Things I have seen before. I am confused and unhappy."
tinder,nz,10.15.1,1,System seems to be built upon making money even if that means giving a false impression of it‚Äôs function in order to keep people subscribed and paying more.Not trustworthy.
tinder,nz,10.15.1,2,Just tried to open an account. Crashes every time I try to upload the photos
tinder,nz,10.15.1,1,"I have had tinder for a while. And paid for the gold version. Generally it has been ok

The latest version is so buggy it is pretty much unusable. Not sure if I will pay for the upgrade in future or look for another app"
tinder,nz,10.15.0,5,"I‚Äôm getting matches but it won‚Äôt let me see them , getting like 10 and still can‚Äôt"
tinder,nz,10.15.0,3,IT JEEPS SAYING IM GETTING MATCHES AND MESSAGES BUT NOTHING IS SHOWING UP. PLEASE GET THESE BACK FOR ME
tinder,nz,10.13.0,3,It was ok till I got banned and didn‚Äôt know why I reckon they should specifically tell me why
tinder,nz,10.12.1,1,Used tinder gold for two months and noticed tinder is trapping people by showing them likes they got which only increases when u don‚Äôt have gold pack. But once you pay for tinder gold there will be no real likes actually there is no way someone can like ur profile.
tinder,nz,10.12.1,1,How do I lower difficulty settings?
tinder,nz,10.12.1,1,"After I paid, get banned just after 1 day."
tinder,nz,10.12.0,1,Tinder crashes every time I try to send a message. Fix your app!!
tinder,nz,10.12.0,3,I paid for a gold subscription but it reverted itself back normal version but it says I have paid for it need help
tinder,nz,10.12.0,1,"I logged back into tinder to discover my account had been banned even though I hadn‚Äôt ‚Äúbroken‚Äù their ‚Äúrules‚Äù. 

Tinder fails to explain why exactly you have been banned and simply will not give you their reasoning as to why your account has been terminated. 

For those actually using the dating app for dating and not hook ups, your chances of actually finding any potential companions will not be accomplished through the app- as you are not allowed to use the same phone number or account you used for your banned account. 

Upon complaining to tinder yourself, you get a response of ‚Äòbreaking community guidelines‚Äô and are unable to unban the account. I personally think you should get a message prior to getting the account banned like other apps. 

I do not suggest using this app, due to this reasoning."
tinder,nz,10.12.0,1,"Messages not sending, unable to message new matches, getting notifications that new messages are coming but then not being able to see them... sort it out"
tinder,nz,10.11.0,1,"I was banned from this site after 8weeks.  No warnings or no advice to why my account was blocked/banned.  I never used foul language or showed any inappropriate pictures when I was on tinder.  Found most males on this site are scammer from other countries when they said they were from New Zealand, which they were not.   Poor service from Tinder"
tinder,nz,10.11.0,1,"Tinder NOW requires all types of verification before you make an account! But when it doesn‚Äôt even accept them that‚Äôs foolish!! Stupid App has all types of issues including changing your search age ranges & matching you with people in other countries even though your settings are specifically set at a maximum distance of a 30km!!!
Would not recommend it‚Äôs use!!!"
tinder,nz,10.11.0,1,"If you like feeling alone and wanna see how many matches you don‚Äôt get be like me and join this journey as the millions of other guys that wanna feel like one day they will get someone but tinder tells you straight that you might have 27 likes but you will never match with them 

Your alone and don‚Äôt you worry your not the only one üëåüèª"
tinder,nz,10.11.0,5,i downloaded this and within a week i was pullin lassss biddies ü•õüí¶
tinder,nz,10.11.0,1,"Do not subscribe to the automatic renewal subscription. I cancelled my account weeks ago and it still took the money. Tinder then blames Apple and Apple simply refuse to refund. Welcome to the shake-down. Rubbish app and worthless, spineless service. Avoid."
tinder,nz,10.11.0,5,Great app. Got lots of roots.
tinder,nz,10.10.1,3,"The App designed good, easy to use. But after 4 mth experience I notice there have lots of scammers there. Please can adding distance be compulsory? It‚Äôs just weird when people saying they in same country but can‚Äôt add distance."
tinder,nz,10.10.0,1,"Banned for no reason!! On and off banning too, What for? I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IF YOU LIKED GETTING BANNED AT ANY CERTAIN TIME!"
tinder,nz,10.9.1,1,I wouldn‚Äôt recommend signing up for xtras it‚Äôs all a huge scam it seems!! After signing up to Tinder after a recent brake up I was excited to be back on it but boy was it short lived. I signed up to tinder plus paying $25 which isn‚Äôt to much but to only be banned 48 hours later is ridiculous. I‚Äôve emailed but it seems I won‚Äôt hear a back and this is a super common problem for people signing up and then being banned for no reason and no explanation. I know I had a very tamed profile as I‚Äôve seen other girls profiles from friends accounts in the past And I hardly had the chance to talk to anyone I had 3 conversations open at the time I was blocked that‚Äôs it.... would love a refund or a explanation on why you had blocked me as soon as you get money??
tinder,nz,10.9.1,1,"Started an account, went to add a photo to said account, got logged out, and then told I was banned. That was about a year ago. Decided that maybe the ban would be over so I tried to log in again today but nope still banned. Emailed customer service and they said they don‚Äôt appeal bans so guess i‚Äôll be using other dating apps instead"
tinder,nz,10.9.1,1,"Like many other reviews, banned for no reason! No ways to check what rules you allegedly broke at all. Very poor service considering I was a gold member."
tinder,nz,10.8.1,2,"FEATURE REQUEST:
Please incorporate a right-swipe countdown so you can see how many you have left.

ISSUES:
Profile photos and names of matches are constantly randomly switched around, making it completely confusing to figure out who I'm actually talking to."
tinder,nz,10.8.0,1,"Banned for no reason. no reason given and was paying to use the service,terrible customer support would not recommend try bumble"
tinder,nz,10.8.0,1,"I was banned without any reason, I contacted technical support for to know the reason but they did not give any coherent answers, very bad service"
tinder,nz,10.7.0,1,Doesn‚Äôt even work üôÑ
tinder,nz,10.7.0,1,"So now, unless you PAY, you only have a limited amount of likes per day???
Startin to think this is just another money makin scam.
Sounds like there is no app support either‚Ä¶never any replies to people who voice problems through reviews or app support.
Dodgy as."
tinder,nz,10.7.0,5,I got banned and idk why. üò≠
tinder,nz,10.7.0,1,I don‚Äôt like this app at all they charge so and no use I have change without knowing please refund my money please. Waste of money.
tinder,nz,10.7.0,1,"Was banned for no reason, and upon emailing customer support was not even told the reason I was banned. Automated email was sent to me linking terms and conditions which I did not break - tinder support does not review bans and I think is manned entirely by robots. Had a gold membership too - think I was one of the few people using the app to actually meet people rather than get Instagram followers but now I can‚Äôt get on at all. Thanks Tinder for making sure I‚Äôll be alone forever! üò°"
tinder,nz,10.5.0,5,"Seriously, this is the best app for meeting that special person in your life. If you're looking for a hook up then good luck. If you're looking for true love, it's on Tinder. I met someone 5 years ago and have been married to her 3 years. You get out of Tinder what you put into it. If you put love in then that's what you'll get out."
tinder,nz,10.5.0,1,"Pretty sure I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, went on a date and we didn‚Äôt like each other then next thing I‚Äôm banned haha! Coincidence? I think not. Stupid."
tinder,nz,10.5.0,1,"Horrible!!! 

Watch out you‚Äôll get band within your first hours of being active on the account, and banned for no apparent reason! Oh and no refund at all... so don‚Äôt even bother signing up for Tinder Gold! And the customer service is terrible! This is a huge let down Tinder! Can‚Äôt believe you ban people for life just like that. Tinder was actually my happy place where I could go and talk to people since I‚Äôm shy... now I don‚Äôt have it at all and I‚Äôm depressed. I would like a refund and an explanation or just my account back thank you!"

tinder,nz,10.5.0,2,"Banned before I even managed to swipe, nothing against any rules. No way to contact their team. 

Highly disappointed. Glad I did not pay for it."
tinder,nz,10.5.0,1,Every time I go into the app it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve started from scratch. It shows messages when there are no nee ones. All the matches I‚Äôve previously viewed and clicked on are now all showing as new matches again so it‚Äôs very frustrating. These bugs are creating too many admin jobs for me to enjoy using the app the way it was designed.
tinder,nz,10.5.0,1,"To many fake profiles. Waste of money getting gold.. sure lots of likes and matches..all fake. Pretty sure Tinder endorses theses fakes. funny how before your subscription ends all the fake profiles start trying to string you along so you renew. It‚Äôs possible to get real dates but 90% fake make the whole thing painful. Easier to just talking to face to face, the odds would be much higher. SO MANY FAKE PROFILES!! Save your time."

tinder,nz,10.5.0,1,"I have sent you an Instagram message because I couldn‚Äôt find any other way on contacting you at all. The app signed me out and wouldn‚Äôt let me sign back in and when it did I had lost all my matches and messages, can this be restored? I had a date this week but now no longer as I can‚Äôt talk to the person anymore..."
tinder,nz,10.4.1,1,"Update after update it never fixes. App crashes, freezes, mixes up people‚Äôs profile pictures so you have no idea who you‚Äôre talking to. Not even worth the hassle any more."

tinder,nz,10.4.1,3,"Please fix some of the swipe glitches and lag, it‚Äôll help tremendously"
tinder,nz,10.4.1,1,Nothing is free in this world
tinder,nz,10.4.1,1,This appalling app promotes decadence and rape culture. It has been implicated in the murders of numerous people. Download it at your peril.
tinder,nz,10.4.1,1,"I opened my tinder app as I would normally to find that I was logged out of my account, when I tried to log in with my phone number (which my account was setup with to begin with) tinder has asked me to create my new profile. So I took it on the chin and created a new account after losing 100+ matches and multiple conversations. After setting up my new account I tried to restore purchases (tinder gold) and it came up with a message saying my subscription is tied in with an existing account. I have tried deleting and re-installing the app and updating my iPhone. After further troubleshooting on the tinder app the only advice I could find from help & support was to cancel my subscription through my Apple ID which I am not happy about whatsoever as I have just been charged my monthly fee today. Until this matter is resolved it‚Äôs a 1 star rating from me üëé"
tinder,nz,10.4.0,1,It aint free no more ?? I cnt see the person that liked me or evan msg them..
tinder,nz,10.4.0,1,Cannot turn off the sound unless I quit the app.
tinder,nz,10.4.0,1,"Was banned from my account over a year ago tried to get it again , made with a new Facebook and new email yet still banned from a year ago ?"
tinder,nz,10.4.0,5,"Disappointing if you buy their subscriptions the more you encounter problems. I deleted and created my tinder account for 5 times after i bought the subscription (my tinder plus and gold) than not buying one. I love tinder back 2 years ago where there is no glitches and it ran smoothly finding matches. But now it has lots of problems, poor app, poor customer service and they only after with your money. I discourage you guys to buy their subscription. Believe me it will crash."
tinder,nz,10.4.0,1,I‚Äôve done nothing wrong am the age it‚Äôs saying I need to be and now I‚Äôm unable to even delete the account
tinder,nz,10.4.0,1,You ruined our friend group!
tinder,nz,10.4.0,1,"I purchased the premium version however the app confuses the ppl and the msg are showing in random profile, there is a bug that needs to be fixed. When I spend$150 I accept a app that‚Äôs working properly."
tinder,nz,10.3.0,1,I had Tinder for almost 6 months then one day I couldn‚Äôt get back on. Didn‚Äôt explain why and now lost everyone. The app is great but I‚Äôm disappointed because all I see in reviews is the same problem as me
tinder,nz,10.3.0,1,"Signed up and got banned straight away? Tried to sort it out with tec support and nothings been done i also paid for premium and WAISTED $25!!!
Hadnt even talked to anyone on there literally just downloaded it this is BS i want a refund"
tinder,nz,10.3.0,1,"Tinder developers, Have you removed this Instagram direct hyperlink from profiles???
People, don‚Äôt even update to the new version! You will regret! ü§¢"

tinder,nz,10.2.1,1,I went to login and instead was made to sign up. All my matches were gone:))) and I met some v nice people
tinder,nz,10.2.1,1,Terrible terrible customer service. If they even reply all they‚Äôll do is not read what you sent and paste a copy & paste message and mark your ticket as solved. Just read the other reviews. My account along with my phone number and email has ‚ÄúBeen banned for violating their terms and service.‚Äù I have read the terms and service. I know I haven‚Äôt violated this. I am very upset. Don‚Äôt know how else I‚Äôm going to meet anyone considering my isolated location but okay üòÇ no one cares.
tinder,nz,10.2.0,1,"Aƒü baƒülantƒ±sƒ± ba≈üarƒ±sƒ±z diyip duruyor, kullanamƒ±yoruz!!!"
tinder,nz,10.1.1,1,"There are so many UI glitches, from matches suddenly having their names/pictures switched around to simply not being able to open conversations, and more."
tinder,nz,10.1.1,2,"This app is riddled with bugs, I have contacted support and they cannot help me with it. Images won‚Äôt upload, app crashes constantly."
tinder,nz,10.1.1,1,"Kindly asked customer support why I could no longer access my account. I assumed it was because I hadn‚Äôt been active for a couple of months, so perhaps my account just needed to be reactivated..
I was informed my account had been banned.. (never found out why) however a friend of mine showed my account was still available to be ‚Äòswiped‚Äô from his end. 
I asked customer support if this could be removed.  I find it quite inappropriate to not give access to your customers, but still keep their accounts on the go for people to swipe and message! 
But none of my questions were answered, I simply got a link to their help page, despite my questions being very clear.. horrible service, clearly don‚Äôt care about their users."
tinder,nz,10.0.2,1,Swapped SIM cards an all I get is network error when I swipe an the same 20 matches show up over and over
tinder,nz,10.0.1,1,"I deleted my old account , now I try to create a new one but it doesn‚Äôt log in to my face book or even my phone numbers"
tinder,nz,9.8.1,1,"Terrible app, they ban you without reason"
tinder,nz,9.9.2,1,"This app is now asking for email, a phone number. Obviously I am not comfortable with that as my information may be sold like in the case of Facebook. So please do not ask for information that is not necessary in excuse for ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù protocols!"
tinder,nz,9.9.2,1,"iPhone app keeps logging me out and then won‚Äôt let me sign back in and now have to use from google chrome, plus there‚Äôs little to no help from a real person. Disappointing!!"
tinder,nz,9.9.0,3,"Random resetting of profile. What is with that? Bio gone, photos gone. No longer can update bio. 

It‚Äôs like I was never here. Go figure."
tinder,nz,9.8.1,1,After the update it keeps logging me out I have to log in again and again like a fool! Stupid app update
tinder,nz,9.8.1,1,App constantly asks me to log back in. Customer support is very poor.
tinder,nz,9.8.1,1,"My account always get deleted! I dont know why, but I‚Äôm in the right age or whatever. But my account always get deleted. Not just once, but 5 times! I‚Äôm tired of it. I just feel so bad about the people that I met on Tinder, that became my friends, all gone. Thanks, Tinder!"
tinder,nz,9.8.1,4,"I tried and wait for all the month and all your update but I still can't edit my info in tinder app. Specialy when I got a loop in there and when I clicked on edit info, it just freezed, the app is freezed and there is nothing I can do beside turn it off and open again. 
I am so sorry but I wait for a month now and there is nothing change so I think is the best to leave a feed back, hoping one day you guys can fix it."
tinder,nz,9.8.1,1,Unable to log into my account even though I‚Äôm not doing anything wrong I am following the guidelines it‚Äôs just a joke
tinder,nz,9.8.0,1,"Really buggy pictures are stretched, even though they use to look normal. I have to log in every single time I click on the app. Just ridiculous. If it doesn‚Äôt work like normal soon I‚Äôll be joining bumble and deleting this"
tinder,nz,9.8.0,1,The app deleted all my matches and now keeps crashing I‚Äôve deleted it reinstalled it and updated it and still the same issue fix it thanks.
tinder,nz,9.7.2,1,I got banned for no reason lol fuq tinder
tinder,nz,9.7.2,1,"So I just found out that my account got deleted and I‚Äôve sent them my requested about why did they deleted my tinder account. Still haven‚Äôt heard from them So I‚Äôve tried another way to create a new account through my phone number and email, it doesn‚Äôt work at all so I find this frustrating because I think I have done nothing wrong. Not happy at all."
tinder,nz,9.7.2,1,"I‚Äôve been using Tinder for a few years but now suddenly every time I open the app a non-removable pop-over appears telling me to provide and verify my phone number. Also it tells that if your phone number changes you can NOT recover your Tinder account. This is outrageous. My phone number changes at least once a year, and I will NOT provide it to a data mining firm like Tinder, ever. Afraid I‚Äôll have to delete this app now and will be unable to use it further as the app is blocking all usage."
tinder,nz,9.7.1,1,My numbers been banned and I don‚Äôt even know why... and I can‚Äôt find any support to get information on why or even attempt to fight the ban.
tinder,nz,9.7.1,1,"Iv had tinder afew times 
Just went to down load it and now it wants my phone number you can‚Äôt skip this option 
So I put in my number it sends me a code I put the code in 
And it dose this a further 10 times before I un- installed the app cause it clearly wasn‚Äôt going to let me sign in 
Why yous change things that don‚Äôt need changing I‚Äôll never understand üñïüèº"
tinder,nz,9.7.1,1,Went on tinder plus. Paid $140 or whatever it is then deleted the app a few days later. Came back to it a week later and my plus subscription had been taken. Emails customer support 5 times with 1 auto response that said if you have a question please follow these steps. Thanks Pamela in customer support really earning your money by copying and pasting replies . Plus I‚Äôm still out $140
tinder,nz,9.7.1,1,"Downloaded tinder, had it for 3 months, but got locked out recently. A google search of the error code showed a ‚Äúbreach of the terms and conditions‚Äù, which I read through and could not figure out where I breached. Contacted tinder and they couldn‚Äôt tell me either, but refused to unblock my account, and could not give me any information at all."
tinder,nz,9.7.0,4,Good app in general. Wondering why it now forces you to submit phone number information. More info for big Facebook I guess. Would like an opt-out
tinder,nz,9.7.0,1,"It doesn‚Äôt even let me log in anymore, this app is the most useless app I‚Äôve ever downloaded. DONT DOWNLOAD THIS UNLESS YOU WANT PROBLEMS WITH YOUR PHONE."
tinder,nz,9.6.1,2,You‚Äôve got to do something about the number of fake profiles.
tinder,nz,9.5.0,1,"my tinder account has been banned because of ‚Äòviolation of community guidelines‚Äô which i can say that i 100% did not have violate any of the guidelines. my account had completely appropriate images and content. i emailed a complaint and the only thing replied was repeating that my account was banned because of violating the guidelines and didn‚Äôt help at all, even though i explained my situation. i tried creating a new one with my old facebook account and it was going good for the first 5 minutes until it logged me out and said ‚Äòerror 40303‚Äô, which means my account got banned again. i‚Äôve tried everything and am beyond mad with the customer support and have written this review on multiple app reviewing sites. 0 stars for tinder"
tinder,nz,9.5.0,1,"I got logged out of my account, and now I can‚Äôt get back in because it wants me to make a new one."
tinder,nz,9.5.0,1,"The app won‚Äôt even let me log in, or make a new profile anymore.. there‚Äôs an ‚Äúerror‚Äù message that keeps coming up and stopping the log in, or account creation from happening. It‚Äôs becoming very annoying and has been like this for over a week since I downloaded it. Please can you fix it?"
tinder,nz,9.5.0,1,Awful buggy app. Cant browse. Sometimes see new listings. Maybe 1-3 daily. Thats all. Overhyped nonsense. My friend has the same problem so it isnt isolated. He paid for gold and cant get a refund because hes in a country not listed in the app store.  Sort it out you clowns deceiving us!!!
tinder,nz,9.5.0,1,"Don't bother. Use another dating app Tinder is so broken. It shows only the occasional new person and not the long list of profiles I saw only on first use. Buggy, broken and no fix. Couldn't even get a refund."
tinder,nz,9.5.0,1,Totally lier and fake . Do not spent your money it . All the accounts are fake . Even without confirmation deductions carry on
tinder,nz,9.5.0,1,"Can‚Äôt log in seems no one has luck with customer service, can‚Äôt even make a new account"
tinder,nz,9.5.0,1,Just like the others got told I was banned after paying for gold. Customer service piss poor. And now I see it‚Äôs taken money again after cancelling
tinder,nz,9.5.0,1,About 4 months ago I was logged out of tinder with an error and I‚Äôve deleted and re downloaded this app about 4 times now and I still get the same error I can just never log in ever and it disappointing because the app was a real help and I met someone but now have lost contact because of this so please fix
tinder,nz,9.4.1,1,Have purchased gold version! No benefits of buying that even no increments on matches also! As it gets hang on Iphone 7+ how disappointing is that while you finish your BOOST option and got hang end of second and just went crash no results nothing you could see after using BOOST all are like nonsense! Will not gonna continue to subscribe with tinder anymore! I would give ZERO rating
tinder,nz,9.4.0,1,App keeps crashing.
tinder,nz,9.4.0,3,"It‚Äôs been really good. However sometimes when I delete the app and then reinstall it, when I try to log back into my account with phone number I don‚Äôt receive a text. This has been going on for over a day and still no text message. Very frustrating"
tinder,nz,9.3.0,1,"Never review normally but had to with this one cause it‚Äôs shocking how bad it is! 

Messages are never delivered/ received properly, usually will get a notification that I got a message but the message won‚Äôt appear....very strange and frustrating!

App crashes quite frequently also 

And just to end it off, tinder plus/Gold is WAY OVERPRICED for what you get...

Overall not satisfied. :("
tinder,nz,9.3.0,1,"The app hasn‚Äôt worked for about a week. I have lost all my matches and messages. Tried starting new account, no good as I now don‚Äôt get anyone showing in my area and it just loads the discovery page constantly. When you go to the help and support option with in the app it just says you haven‚Äôt got matches and to be patient. Sooooo unhelpful."
tinder,nz,9.3.0,1,"I‚Äôve now made 3 accounts because every time I try and log in it says ‚Äúlogging in‚Äù and then it goes back to the same thing, log in with face or phone number."
tinder,nz,9.3.0,3,Absolutely hopeless customer support. I‚Äôve been stuck in the fb log in loop for 3 days and after providing information and screenshots Tinder do nothing to fix it! I suggest their Kendall who replies is in fact a bot!  Fix the log in problems Tinder!! ü§¨
tinder,nz,9.3.0,1,How much dose it cost?
tinder,nz,9.2.0,1,Paid for the month $16.49 and haven‚Äôt unlocked tinder plus. Even got an email saying I‚Äôve bought it
tinder,nz,9.2.0,2,Always logs me out. When will this bug be fixed guys?!
tinder,nz,9.1.0,1,"While I‚Äôm using the app it automatically logs me out and request me to log back in, I‚Äôve done both Facebook an number but there is always an error. I have uninstalled both apps and turn my up to date iPhone on and off in result of nothing. Terrible turriblw app. Get rid or the bugs. Fix it please and I will consider giving 4 extra stars."
tinder,nz,9.1.0,1,Can‚Äôt even log in to the app because it fails to send me a verification code to my mobile. Apparently this is a well known issue and many people have it too but it hasn‚Äôt been fixed yet
tinder,nz,9.1.0,1,"Downloaded and paid for tinder plus and got banned (assuming) a week later. Tried to log on one day and got told that my account had been reported and was under review so couldn‚Äôt log on. I tried to contact tinder support and they refused to tell me any details, as far as I was aware I hadn‚Äôt broken any rules or community guidelines but they refused to tell me why I had been reported or what I could do to reactivate my account. A short while later I assume my account was banned as I could no longer even attempt to log on and no one could tell me exactly why. I was advised that I would have to manually unsubscribe from tinder plus (which I had already done) and they charged me again for another monthly subscription weeks after I could no longer access my account. 

Overall very poor customer service considering I was a paying customer (paid for tinder plus) yet no one could tell me exactly why I couldn‚Äôt access my account and was still being charged for the service. As far as I can work out they though I was a bot (lots of matches in a short space of time) as I never sent any kinds of inappropriate messages or had anything inappropriate on my profile. Happy to charge me after I was apparently banned for no reason. Very disappointing."
tinder,nz,9.1.0,1,Now I liked my time on tinder until my ex reported Me for no reason. Now I can‚Äôt use tinder at all which is a pain and the fact you can‚Äôt get your profile back is also a pain. This needs to be fixed I did nothing wrong and with a lot of people the same happens. Doing a review on why a person Was banned to see if there was really an issue could/should be implemented plus a way for people to get their profiles back even a warning would be enough. Hope something is done.
tinder,nz,9.1.0,1,"Had my account banned for no reason, had barely talked to anyone in the days leading up. Went to log in one evening and my account had been deleted.  Support staff are more than useless, offered no detail as to why I was banned then kept linking me to the T&Cs which I‚Äôd already read and hadn‚Äôt violated.  Not to mention I had a gold subscription.  Also a lot of scammers on there too (who of course don‚Äôt get banned). 

A really disappointing app that gives no customer loyalty."
tinder,nz,9.0.1,2,It‚Äôs sad people think they will get a serious relationship out of this happens maybe 2/1000 chance you will meet someone inSync with you that‚Äôs the truth I‚Äôve tried seen most guys don‚Äôt take it seriously it‚Äôs all a big joke to them you can tell by their pictures
tinder,nz,9.0.0,1,Im 18 and its telling me my age isnt accepted
tinder,nz,8.13.0,1,"I‚Äôm unable to sign in, error A:40303 appears every time? I‚Äôve tried contacting costumer support but they won‚Äôt help."
tinder,nz,8.13.0,4,"Umpteen times a week I‚Äôll be logged automatically out and asked to log back into Tinder via Facebook. At least 5 times a week, multiple times a day sometimes, it‚Äôs so annoying. The last time it happened all of my mates and emails got marked as unread, so I manually had to go and open every email and profile to get rid of the unread logo. Please fix this poor technical aspect of the app. The people on the app are nothing but time wasters anyway, getting matches to add to their collection but never meeting."
tinder,nz,8.11.0,1,"Occasional user for several years. Banned one day for no reason. Tinder customer service (if you can even call them that) was completely useless in assisting to restore my account or even let me know what happened. 
Bumble is a far better platform."
tinder,nz,8.11.0,1,Isn't as good as it used to be
tinder,nz,8.11.0,1,"Average at best, slow app, hard to find a real human in between all the bots. Time to go outside a door knock to meet people"
tinder,nz,8.11.0,2,Clunky app. Stop telling me to leave a review every 30 seconds
tinder,nz,8.11.0,1,"Syncs very slowly, doesn't alert to new messages sometimes"
tinder,nz,8.11.0,1,"Hi I paid for this opportunity to find someone out there on your site, however I am getting no feedback and joy when I swipe left or right etc.

I get no messages or replies back, so what‚Äôs going wrong and how can this be fixed.

Because if it‚Äôs not sorted I‚Äôm going to unsubscribe and delete the payment.

Regards Richard."
tinder,nz,8.10.0,2,"For a certain generation with life experience, business savvy, and generally smart, your platform has lots of user unfriendly flaws which your boffins/gurus/nerds/geeks need to address.
Engage with the 50 set and you might learn a thing or two.
The system may work for some, but some aspects defy logic, are impersonal, and don‚Äôt follow a communication flow.
Furthermore you have layers of activity in the site which should all be accessible from a finger touch on one screen.
Feel free to reply, but I doubt anyone will"
tinder,nz,8.10.0,5,I'm writing a review so tinder would stop asking me to do one!
tinder,nz,8.10.0,5,Guarantees matches and much more :)
tinder,nz,8.10.0,1,Annoying ads. Money hungry app devs
tinder,nz,8.10.0,1,"App lags for upto minutes at a time, would love for this to be fixed in the next update!"
tinder,nz,8.10.0,1,No
tinder,nz,8.10.0,2,Just don‚Äôt like the swipe and never be able to recover unless I pay through the nose feature sorry not impressed
tinder,nz,8.9.0,2,"So today there was a glitch in the app. It kept popping with a message saying that I needed to request permission from facebook over and over again. I reinstalled the app and find that all of my matches and conversations are gone. Whatever this is, I hope you can fix it. I have used this app for a while and never encountered such a problem."
tinder,nz,8.9.0,1,Your ads piss me off. Make me want to delete the app.
tinder,nz,8.9.0,1,App is fine but am freaking over it asking to leave a review or give feedback after every click on the app so I thought for the first time I'm going to review because it's annouying me and I am thinking of deleting the app purely for this reason
tinder,nz,8.9.0,5,Rhb
tinder,nz,8.9.0,5,Love the app.  Wouldn‚Äôt live without it
tinder,nz,8.9.0,1,Wouldn't stop harassing me to write a review so here it is.
tinder,nz,8.9.0,2,Stop asking me to write a review
tinder,nz,8.9.0,1,My account was banned for no reason. I had thousands of contacts on it all gone. Tinder support staff are more than useless. Really disappointed in this app. Disgusting customer service after all the money and time iv spent on it. Rediculous
tinder,nz,8.8.0,4,Good app messaging section is a little quirky but otherwise good
tinder,nz,8.8.0,4,Especially the recall option.
tinder,nz,8.8.0,1,"Unread message notifications come
Up for every message in the inbox once you do an update..... not worth the bother am deleting the app."
tinder,nz,8.8.0,5,Lit
tinder,nz,8.8.0,4,Average
tinder,nz,8.8.0,2,It seems most people just like being swiped. They barely message & when they do they‚Äôre scammers. Or seem to lack the ability to converse.
tinder,nz,8.8.0,1,It's a cool app but it asks for a rating every two minutes.
tinder,nz,8.8.0,1,Why do I have to log in and go through the tutorial every time I use tinder.
tinder,nz,8.8.0,1,Stop ripping us of with all the fees we pay for this app zzz
tinder,nz,8.8.0,1,1 star as it keeps asking me to review the stupid app
tinder,nz,8.8.0,1,Reduce your fees please. They are too expensive.
tinder,nz,8.8.0,1,Is there any decent men?
tinder,nz,8.8.0,4,It's a great up its get tedious after a while
tinder,nz,8.8.0,1,Too many working girls and scammers
tinder,nz,8.8.0,3,Tinder needs to sort out all of these one picture fake accounts and catfishes.
tinder,nz,8.7.0,1,"Tinder used to be ad-free but no longer. 
Not only are the ads annoying, they are completely irrelevant and they start blaring out sound before you can swipe them left. 
Nor can I find an option in settings to have the sound off like you can in many other apps. 
To get rid of the ads you of course have to pay money."
tinder,nz,8.6.0,1,"Tinder has become a disappointment, if someone reports for whatever reason then it deletes your account, we had nothing offensive on our profile just a couple seeking others and we kept getting deleted, what a joke isn't this a dating app after all?"
tinder,nz,8.5.0,1,"Can only sign up using phone or facebook, dumb as I don‚Äôt use either. What happened to email?"
tinder,nz,8.5.0,5,üëçawesome
tinder,nz,8.5.0,1,This app doesn‚Äôt let me log in anymore under facebook or my cellphone number??? Fix this.
tinder,nz,8.5.0,1,don‚Äôt buy tinder gold it‚Äôs useless.
tinder,nz,8.4.1,1,This is the third time I have had to restart. My account/matches just disappears. Very disappointed in this.
tinder,nz,8.4.1,5,"Loved fu*king these white gym girls their squat asses were out of this world, unfortunately I'm in hospital with potential HIV. 5 star rating"
tinder,nz,8.4.1,2,"The app (latest version) often crashes and has these weird twitches which require logging in again (currently logging in again is resulting in code 1009). Most curious. This happens on the previous as well as the current version. (iPhone 7, iOS 11.2.1)"
tinder,nz,iOS 8.4.0,1,Keeps crashing down. Only allows 1 app running at a time
tinder,nz,iOS 8.4.0,4,Good
tinder,nz,iOS 8.4.0,5,"The beauty of Tinder is the GPS ranging. Searching amongst a nearby pool makes for convenience and relevance. It is especially geared towards hookups, but of course you may be open to long-term things too. It is easy to make your position clear in a polite and respectful way. My profile says ‚ÄúI am open to something long term but hey, this is Tinder and life is short ‚Äú. I am slightly open to that. 
In NZ, I find there are lots of ladies who don‚Äôt get this elegant aspect of distance. When I see a profile 23 or 97 km away, I know this someone who has swiped right on me and is most likely to have their range setting high and their sights on a permanent partner. I swipe right just in case they found me and then drove to their cousins party before I could respond. Mostly that is not the case in Aotearoa!
Of course there are scammers and presumably call girls, but that is the same elsewhere."
tinder,nz,iOS 8.4.0,5,So much dick
tinder,nz,8.3.1,5,I've had two dates in over two years off this app. Nothing but thumbs in the upward direction from me. Jolly terrific.
tinder,nz,8.3.1,5,Good as g
tinder,nz,8.3.1,4,Great app but makes the iPhone 7 crash rather occasionally.
tinder,nz,8.3.0,1,Will not send me code to login so cannot use the app
tinder,nz,8.3.0,1,"Even though I have most recent version can‚Äôt see anyone‚Äôs photos so what‚Äôs the point? Please fix
And yes my iPhone 6s software is up to date"
tinder,nz,8.2.0,2,Iam on ipad 2 . The icon of the app is like a ¬´ no app ¬ª iccon. It like that seems week and there is not update for it. For an ios version its pretty unserious. They spent more time to add extra paid feature that put corrective stuff.
tinder,nz,8.2.0,5,"Fantastic app to chat n date n to make frnds
Hats off to tinder mgt tem n its members
Plz dont adk for money
Looks bit cheap 
Skout is compared wid it if tinder ask for money"
tinder,nz,8.2.0,3,Great app but crashes every now and then.
tinder,nz,7.8.0,5,Lo mejor de lo mejor
tinder,nz,8.1.0,2,"Great update, but impossible to use with the lag and how long it takes to come back from the lag"
tinder,nz,8.0.1,2,Every time I exit out of the app I have to restart my phone. Can this be fixed please
tinder,nz,8.0.1,2,"can‚Äôt use any other app with tinder open, causes my phone to freeze"
tinder,nz,8.0.1,1,App crashes and burns like 99% of the ur tinder matches.
tinder,nz,8.0.1,5,Yalannnn ba≈ükasƒ± yalan
tinder,nz,8.0.1,1,"Omg, the latest update - terrible!!! Soooooo un-user friendly - and yes, I've read the updated instructions, but why make it more complicated? Why???"
tinder,nz,8.0.0,1,With me still owning a 5s the new update that allows you to look through a persons photos without opening their profile has added a considerable amount of lag to the point where I can't even use your app anymore. Please fix this or I will be forced to no longer be of use to your service.
tinder,nz,8.0.0,1,"Sick of the notification bugs, too many fake profiles, you don‚Äôt have to be a detective to figure out which ones are fake. Don‚Äôt bother wasting money on this app, it‚Äôs just another cash grab to lure in desperate people."
tinder,nz,7.7.2,1,Full of fake profiles
tinder,nz,7.8.1,2,"Always seems to be something wrong with this app. Currently it says I have a message but doesn‚Äôt want to load it, be nice to be able to know it will work"
tinder,nz,7.8.1,1,I bought tinder gold subscription but cant open my account from last 3 days
tinder,nz,7.8.1,3,"Too many fake profiles , too much spam offering cam sites"
tinder,nz,7.8.1,3,It's ok but just annoying that there's some fakes on it
tinder,nz,7.8.1,5,Think mines broken not getting any matches
tinder,nz,7.8.1,1,Keep getting notifications but the messages don't appear or the notifications stay there even though you have seen the message.
tinder,nz,7.8.1,5,Now stop asking.
tinder,nz,7.8.1,5,Good app
tinder,nz,7.8.1,3,Good job
tinder,nz,7.8.0,5,"Greatness is achieved not through effort, but through Tinder."
tinder,nz,7.7.1,1,Keeps losing everything and you have to log out and in to get back. Then when you log in you can see the first line of message on the message page but when you go into the thread it's not there.
tinder,nz,7.7.2,1,So it's been over a month now I haven't been able to use the group part of the app and now it's disappeared all together?? Neither me or my mate could delete the group to make a new one it just won't show at all. Barely use this app at all now I'm forever having problems with it.
tinder,nz,7.7.2,2,It's OK but.... IM 18 AND I HATE IT HOW 22 IS THE MINIMUM AGE ON THE OLDER SIDE LIKE PLS I DONT WANT TO MATCH WITH 22 YEAR OLDS I WANT 19-20 MAX BUT IT WONT LET ME GO ANY LOWER
tinder,nz,7.7.2,1,This app was great. But recently I've stopped receiving notifications when I get a match or a message. But I still get notifications asking me to get a paid account. My matches seem to have the same problem. Some of them never reply or reply days later saying they never got a notification. This is only a recent thing but needs to be fixed or it's pretty much unusable
tinder,nz,7.7.2,3,"This app consistently packed to the gunnels with blatantly obvious catfish and nothing ever seems to be done by Tinder to stop this over abundance, nor does it appear they  ever audit for this. I'm talking the NZ version here. Given this unwillingness to combat the issue it's not hard to lean towards this being intentional as the less than intelligent superlike these catfish repeatedly at a cost to themselves whilst lining the tinder execs pockets. Shameful and poorly run app"
tinder,nz,7.7.2,5,Chur
tinder,nz,7.7.2,3,"Good app, got some decent laughs out of it, would be 5 stars if I could get more that 3 matches... Oh wait, I'm ugly"
tinder,nz,7.7.1,4,Just started but so far so good
tinder,nz,7.7.2,5,Lovely experience 5 stars *****
tinder,nz,7.7.1,5,"App is good, but sometime loading process is very slow."
tinder,nz,7.7.1,3,Have had some really nice times because of Tinder :) it's not the app's fault if some dates are bad or some people are jerks.
tinder,nz,7.7.1,1,Meh
tinder,nz,7.6.1,5,"At first I thought it was a myth, love on social media? Dating applications have never bought anything but pain and misery. However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel and I am living proof. Happily married with 3 kids all thanks to tinder."
tinder,nz,7.6.1,5,Awesomeüëçüèº
tinder,nz,7.6.1,3,Too many fake profiles. Asked to review too often.
tinder,nz,7.6.1,5,Pretty good
tinder,nz,7.6.1,2,I haven't been able to see new messages even though I have had notifications that I have new messages. The people who sent the messages are still a match so the reason for the messages not showing up is unknown.
tinder,nz,7.6.1,5,It is great
tinder,nz,7.6.1,1,"I like tinder but because it keeps pestering me to rate it, you get nothing from me."
tinder,nz,7.5.3,1,So many fake profiles. I'm guessing 1 in 4. In New Zealand anyway. I reversed image searches some and all are massive instragram models. One even come back as Kylie Jenner??? Wtf. Cmon tinder surely you can factor into your algorithm images stolen from the models that have over 50 k followers.... gutted I bought a premium subscription... 0.5 stars
tinder,nz,7.6.1,5,I have almost 800 matches (791) and I get laid 24/7 üëçüèºüòè
tinder,nz,7.6.1,1,Where did all these fake accounts come from? I'm in an area that yeah will get a few now and again but now it's just fake counts everywhere. Didn't have this issue before the latest updates came through
tinder,nz,7.6.1,4,"I miss the good old days when tinder used to be free, and you had unlimited swipes. I miss the constant right swiping while doing other things. I'm Chinese, so paying for premiums is a no no for me. Too cheap for that fam."
tinder,nz,7.6.0,3,Literally asking for reviews all the time. And won't let me post a review everytime I've tried
tinder,nz,7.6.0,5,Whenever you need a tour guide and fun chick out with? This is my go to option!
tinder,nz,7.6.0,1,Updated to new version and about 95% of profiles are clearly fake. Why would I pay for this app when all I can do is look at fake profiles?
tinder,nz,7.6.0,1,"Most of the profiles are fake! It would be a good app otherwise...
Update 2017/07/20 still mostly fake profiles"
tinder,nz,7.6.0,4,Hope this will stop it asking me for a review.
tinder,nz,7.5.3,4,Great app
tinder,nz,7.5.3,5,Big tune.
tinder,nz,7.5.3,4,Title says it all
tinder,nz,7.5.3,5,Its really helpful n easy to use üòäüòäüòäüòäü§ôü§ôü§ô
tinder,nz,7.5.3,5,A great app. It's fun! :)
tinder,nz,7.5.3,4,"Love the app, had an issue with notification symbol, says I have 1 notification but no message or match? Won't go away"
tinder,nz,7.5.3,5,–°—É–ø–µ—Ä
tinder,nz,7.5.3,4,Great and easy to use üëçüèΩ
tinder,nz,7.5.3,1,"Got a notification that I've received multiple messages, however no messages load in the app itself. Also, get ready to be bugged to provide feedback/rate the app every 5 seconds."
tinder,nz,7.5.3,4,"Tinder is fabulous! Good way to pass the time when kinda tipsy and bored, but needs an update. Because it's kind of.. sleazy? More sophisticated features!!"
tinder,nz,7.5.3,4,It's a great app
tinder,nz,7.5.3,5,Dhdhhdhd
tinder,nz,7.5.3,4,Great app
tinder,nz,7.5.2,5,So good
tinder,nz,7.5.2,1,"Constantly asking me to review the app leads to reviews like that. Give me an option to say ""I never ever want to review your app"" and maybe then I'll give you a better one."
tinder,nz,7.5.2,5,Total decent
tinder,nz,7.4.0,5,Perfect
tinder,nz,7.5.1,3,"Since the last update I can't even open it. 
Please fix it!!
It's been a week without tinder and I really miss it."
tinder,nz,7.5.1,1,"The app keeps crashing, it doesn't even open."
tinder,nz,7.5.1,5,Great!
tinder,nz,7.5.1,5,Chur mean az
tinder,nz,7.5.1,3,It's frustrating!
tinder,nz,7.5.1,5,Every 10 minutes I get asked to write a review is the only real negative thing about the app write your review and leave me alone xx
tinder,nz,7.4.1,3,Reviewed!
tinder,nz,7.4.1,5,Literally Bang on
tinder,nz,7.4.1,5,Beautiful app so easy to use!!!!
tinder,nz,7.4.1,5,So far so good!!
tinder,nz,7.4.1,1,"It seems that every time I use this App I'm requested to give a review via Tinder's proprietary system (not published on the App Store). Here's my review: stop harassing your users, it makes for a very annoying experience."
tinder,nz,7.3.1,5,Odd app but can waste a couple minutes swiping
tinder,nz,7.3.1,4,More of a time killer than a love maker
tinder,nz,7.3.1,1,^
tinder,nz,7.3.1,4,Potato potato it works
tinder,nz,7.1.1,1,Overwhelming full of fake spam profiles
tinder,nz,7.3.0,5,Yea na ye
tinder,nz,7.3.0,5,"The only negative thing I can say about this app is that it easily allows fake accounts on the app so most of the time your swiping right to pretty but ""fake"" girls/boys, but I digress still an amazing app overall."
tinder,nz,7.3.0,5,Absolute mintüëå
tinder,nz,7.2.2,1,Can't even get past the code verification screen
tinder,nz,7.2.2,5,"Really slow on IPhone 4s, please fix this! Takes ages to swipe through profiles, as it swipes really slow for some reason haha"
tinder,nz,7.2.2,2,Just after a few swipes my surrounding area would stop loading! At the end I have to restart my account causing me to lost everything!
tinder,nz,7.2.2,3,"Instead of writing suggestions about how to approach someone you haven't messaged yet, that screen should include interesting fun facts like the pads they use in Australia."
tinder,nz,7.2.2,5,would recommend to other singles. All types of women that you never knew you could go on a date with
tinder,nz,7.2.1,2,Lots of blank profiles being loaded. Update was a failure.
tinder,nz,7.2.1,4,"Haha whether you're on tinder for fun or future, it's a different way to meet someone , and I guess one way to avoid an awkward no , or a embarrassing rejection. Whatever your reason.. it's worth a try."
tinder,nz,7.2.0,1,"First deleted some of my pictures, and now deleted all my matches and conversations. Also is increasingly full of fake profiles. Don't recommend"
tinder,nz,7.2.0,5,Great app haha
tinder,nz,7.2.1,5,Good app
tinder,nz,7.2.0,1,"So if you rate the app in Tinder, it only passes on 4/5 star to App Store - everything else it sends to their internal feedback. So the reviews here are very filtered and misleading.
Also, some push notifications are just plain lies to try to get you to use the app more.
Last update got even worse, marked all my messages as unread so now my badge count is way off."
tinder,nz,7.2.0,1,brokennnnn
tinder,nz,7.1.1,1,It forced me to write a review
tinder,nz,7.1.1,5,very good
tinder,nz,7.1.1,1,Since doing the updates. There is no tinder app showing under the Facebook settings. So I now cannot access it at all
tinder,nz,7.1.0,5,App seems ok but it doesnt seem to work. Im not getting any matches. Please fix. Thanks
tinder,nz,7.1.1,2,"Great job keeping me entertained swiping in different locations that's fine. 
I love swiping in America so to have a voice message function would be fun! 
I would really love a voice message function I love American accents. 

And also a fun compatibility % that would be cool"
tinder,nz,7.1.1,4,"Great app just annoying that I get American profiles, they're  either fake or gps is off"
tinder,nz,7.1.0,1,I can't swipe because it won't load!!
tinder,nz,7.1.0,1,So frustrated. Home page is continuously loading with no people showing up to swipe... It's been hours
tinder,nz,7.1.0,4,"It's not great, but it delivers what you expect, so can't fault the developers. If you don't think this is internet dating, then think again. You'll get bots and catfishes every so often, but if you endure long enough, someone real will appear in front of you."
tinder,nz,7.1.0,1,What's with the app? I'm getting people from America and I don't even live there. Fix your app
tinder,nz,7.1.0,1,I swear like 80% of the accounts are fake and it's super frustrating :(
tinder,nz,6.9.4,1,"Used to love the app. Lately, it's become terrible. Literally have to swipe through hundreds of bots just to find a few real profiles. Surely you can sort this out Tinder? Pick up your game."
tinder,nz,7.0.1,5,üíïüíïüòä
tinder,nz,7.0.1,1,This app is nothing but bots. I don't bother swiping anymore because it's all just fake profiles.
tinder,nz,7.0.1,1,95% fake female profiles
tinder,nz,7.0.1,5,AmaZing!
tinder,nz,7.0.1,1,I'm using this app cause I'm bored most of the time but when you realize how often you get matched with bots just think about how easy it'll be to get your identity stolen and replicated for goddamn catfishes
tinder,nz,7.0.1,5,Love but too many fake profiles
tinder,nz,7.0.1,5,Meet the love of your live
tinder,nz,7.0.1,5,"It works ok, can get a bit of action but nothing special about it,"
tinder,nz,7.0.1,2,The app would be a million times better if a Captcha was used on sign up and on all existing accounts. Bots ruin everything.
tinder,nz,7.0.1,3,I've read about there being other gender options apart from male and female but I'm only able to choose those two. I identify as a Lockheed AC-130 Gunship and I'm stuck being a male. Send help and/or nudes.
tinder,nz,6.9.4,5,Yea nah good
tinder,nz,6.9.4,2,There are way too many spam bots in this app and it's putting me off. I regret that I paid for tinder plus
tinder,nz,6.9.4,5,This app has helped me get laid more than bricks in an old factory. Do recommend.
tinder,nz,6.9.3,1,"So can't even log in on the opening screen past Facebook before it crashes... Looks like few people having this issue, has it been fixed.. NO! 2 weeks now"
tinder,nz,6.9.3,1,"People I swiped left on popping up 3 swipes later, logging me out once a day, buttons not responding. Filled with bugs"
tinder,nz,6.9.3,1,It won't even let me go past the Facebook log in button...
tinder,nz,6.9.3,4,Great App.. good way of chatting.. it is what you make of it.
tinder,nz,6.9.3,1,Messaged support multiple times and no one has gotten back to me. Terrible.
tinder,nz,6.9.3,5,Great app.
tinder,nz,6.9.3,4,Full of fakes sometimes but generally good
tinder,nz,6.9.3,1,Crashes on start up please fix
tinder,nz,6.9.1,5,"My experience so far as a sincere 46 year old guy has been great - seems full of real people, very direct and clear to see who's interested in who. enjoying messaging with people i've matched, not at all the sleazy place i feared..."
tinder,nz,6.9.1,2,"On iPhone 4. I have to disconnect from Internet, open app, reconnect to Internet, sign in again on fb then go to the app. This usually works, but I have to do all of this. Every. Single. Time..."
tinder,nz,6.9.1,4,So much less creepy than Grindr or hornet
tinder,nz,6.9.1,5,"Totally recommend, it's safe and as privet as you want, helped me meet interesting people, you'll find strange people as well but easy to disconnect too... go for it!"
tinder,nz,6.9.1,1,Not receiving messages from matches
tinder,nz,6.9.1,2,I've had nothing but glitches and bugs....it's almost impossible to remove or change profile pictures and sometimes when swiping the profile you've just liked will randomly change right before you finish your swipe. Who knows who I'm actually rating. This app gets a left swipe from me.
tinder,nz,6.9.0,5,Really good app!!!
tinder,nz,6.9.0,1,New tinder isn't what it used to be. Need to find a new one
tinder,nz,6.8.1,1,It's pretty good most of the time but it glitches a lot and my matches and messages disappear!
tinder,nz,6.8.1,1,Please update the crashes in app before asking money for Pro options
tinder,nz,6.8.1,1,The app glitches and all my matches/messages are gone üò°üò° it always closes by itself
tinder,nz,6.8.0,1,"Can never use it, it always says 'Server Error' and doesn't let you log in. Even after deleting and downloading it again it's the same"
tinder,nz,6.8.1,5,Love this app!!! I was travelling in Europe and met the guy of my dreams thanks to tinder <3
tinder,nz,6.8.0,1,"I have yet again lost ALL my matches! Could you please fix this issue? This is not the first time something like this has happened! I do not want to restart my entire tinder profile!
I had over 3500 matches that took me two years to build up! Please fix this immediately!!"
tinder,nz,6.8.0,1,u have to use fakebook to have a tinder account? come on
tinder,nz,6.8.0,1,New update is buggy on iPhone 7 plus. App freezes.
tinder,nz,6.7.0,1,"Been trying to login to Facebook for the past few days, consistently failing logins and with no clear options on the app on how to address this

With them expecting people to pay for app, not sure if it's worth it"
tinder,nz,6.7.0,1,App isn't working. Had no matches and I'm a solid 3/10

tinder,nz,7.1.1,4,"Great app just annoying that I get American profiles, they're  either fake or gps is off"
tinder,nz,7.1.0,1,I can't swipe because it won't load!!
tinder,nz,7.1.0,1,So frustrated. Home page is continuously loading with no people showing up to swipe... It's been hours
tinder,nz,7.1.0,4,"It's not great, but it delivers what you expect, so can't fault the developers. If you don't think this is internet dating, then think again. You'll get bots and catfishes every so often, but if you endure long enough, someone real will appear in front of you."
tinder,nz,7.1.0,1,What's with the app? I'm getting people from America and I don't even live there. Fix your app
tinder,nz,7.1.0,1,I swear like 80% of the accounts are fake and it's super frustrating :(
tinder,nz,6.9.4,1,"Used to love the app. Lately, it's become terrible. Literally have to swipe through hundreds of bots just to find a few real profiles. Surely you can sort this out Tinder? Pick up your game."
tinder,nz,7.0.1,5,üíïüíïüòä
tinder,nz,7.0.1,1,This app is nothing but bots. I don't bother swiping anymore because it's all just fake profiles.
tinder,nz,7.0.1,1,95% fake female profiles
tinder,nz,7.0.1,5,AmaZing!
tinder,nz,7.0.1,1,I'm using this app cause I'm bored most of the time but when you realize how often you get matched with bots just think about how easy it'll be to get your identity stolen and replicated for goddamn catfishes
tinder,nz,7.0.1,5,Love but too many fake profiles
tinder,nz,7.0.1,5,Meet the love of your live
tinder,nz,7.0.1,5,"It works ok, can get a bit of action but nothing special about it,"
tinder,nz,7.0.1,2,The app would be a million times better if a Captcha was used on sign up and on all existing accounts. Bots ruin everything.
tinder,nz,7.0.1,3,I've read about there being other gender options apart from male and female but I'm only able to choose those two. I identify as a Lockheed AC-130 Gunship and I'm stuck being a male. Send help and/or nudes.
tinder,nz,6.9.4,5,Yea nah good
tinder,nz,6.9.4,2,There are way too many spam bots in this app and it's putting me off. I regret that I paid for tinder plus
tinder,nz,6.9.4,5,This app has helped me get laid more than bricks in an old factory. Do recommend.
tinder,nz,6.9.3,1,"So can't even log in on the opening screen past Facebook before it crashes... Looks like few people having this issue, has it been fixed.. NO! 2 weeks now"
tinder,nz,6.9.3,1,"People I swiped left on popping up 3 swipes later, logging me out once a day, buttons not responding. Filled with bugs"
tinder,nz,6.9.3,1,It won't even let me go past the Facebook log in button...
tinder,nz,6.9.3,4,Great App.. good way of chatting.. it is what you make of it.
tinder,nz,6.9.3,1,Messaged support multiple times and no one has gotten back to me. Terrible.
tinder,nz,6.9.3,5,Great app.
tinder,nz,6.9.3,4,Full of fakes sometimes but generally good
tinder,nz,6.9.3,1,Crashes on start up please fix
tinder,nz,6.9.1,5,"My experience so far as a sincere 46 year old guy has been great - seems full of real people, very direct and clear to see who's interested in who. enjoying messaging with people i've matched, not at all the sleazy place i feared..."
tinder,nz,6.9.1,2,"On iPhone 4. I have to disconnect from Internet, open app, reconnect to Internet, sign in again on fb then go to the app. This usually works, but I have to do all of this. Every. Single. Time..."
tinder,nz,6.9.1,4,So much less creepy than Grindr or hornet
tinder,nz,6.9.1,5,"Totally recommend, it's safe and as privet as you want, helped me meet interesting people, you'll find strange people as well but easy to disconnect too... go for it!"
tinder,nz,6.9.1,1,Not receiving messages from matches
tinder,nz,6.9.1,2,I've had nothing but glitches and bugs....it's almost impossible to remove or change profile pictures and sometimes when swiping the profile you've just liked will randomly change right before you finish your swipe. Who knows who I'm actually rating. This app gets a left swipe from me.
tinder,nz,6.9.0,5,Really good app!!!
tinder,nz,6.9.0,1,New tinder isn't what it used to be. Need to find a new one
tinder,nz,6.8.1,1,It's pretty good most of the time but it glitches a lot and my matches and messages disappear!

tinder,nz,6.8.0,1,"Can never use it, it always says 'Server Error' and doesn't let you log in. Even after deleting and downloading it again it's the same"
tinder,nz,6.8.1,5,Love this app!!! I was travelling in Europe and met the guy of my dreams thanks to tinder <3
tinder,nz,6.8.0,1,"I have yet again lost ALL my matches! Could you please fix this issue? This is not the first time something like this has happened! I do not want to restart my entire tinder profile!
I had over 3500 matches that took me two years to build up! Please fix this immediately!!"
tinder,nz,6.8.0,1,u have to use fakebook to have a tinder account? come on

tinder,gh,11.9.0,1,"I just paid for tinder plus and I can‚Äôt see any of my messages, can you please fix the problem, what is going on?!"
tinder,gh,11.6.1,1,"The fact that u Banned un-notice is bad.

If there‚Äôs a complain u should notify instead. 
U know how it feels like to loose friends u can‚Äôt get back some times?
U know what it feels like to cancel ur subscription to Tinder-plus.
#SAVAGE"
tinder,gh,11.6.0,1,"The app is super fun & interesting but my account was banned for no reason, as I‚Äôve always followed the rules so there has to be some mistake. It‚Äôs been banned for about 5months now and I find that absolutely ridiculous."
tinder,gh,11.4.0,1,When I downloaded this app I hoped I could get some results but after uploading photos when I click on continue it shows me ‚Äúsomething went wrong please try later‚Äù can you guys help me?

tinder,gh,10.17.0,5,Great site
tinder,gh,10.17.0,5,Cool but very boring
tinder,gh,10.13.0,1,Why must Tinder block me without due reason after payment of 6month subscription. I believe it is just fair to give specific reasons for closing some someone‚Äôs account. What were the terms and conditions that lead to the blocking of my account. I surely need a refund for this action you took.
tinder,gh,10.2.0,3,"I just opened my tinder account 2 days ago, just started using it today, while I was on your app it shut down on its own and refused to open again, have deleted tinder and reinstalled it like 3 times now but I can‚Äôt find my account nor can I create a new one.

tinder,ng,12.1.0,5,"Your app is great and incredible, gotten some great friends there.

I believe you really need to add a video call option. It‚Äôs only fair as a dating app, people need to be able to see who they are chatting with (if they‚Äôll love to) before exchanging personal contacts."

tinder,ng,10.13.0,2,"I just started using this app & I must say, it‚Äôs just ok. It‚Äôs really slow, meshes don‚Äôt deliver on time, closing the app every time so that the messages an show.

it takes time to load pictures and videos"
tinder,ng,10.11.0,1,"Why do tinder always ban my account?? I don‚Äôt post nudes, I agree to ur terms, people randomly report accounts just because they don‚Äôt comply with their demands, and the only tin u can come up with is to ban me?? This is outrageously absurd and annoying."

tinder,sg,12.1.0,1,The app is so laggy. Especially the chat feature
tinder,sg,12.1.0,1,Please update dark mode
tinder,sg,12.1.0,1,"It seems that Tinder does not try to improve and relies on reputation. Too bad, many other similar apps offer better quality and service. This one will not survive for long unless it changes."
tinder,sg,12.1.0,5,"I have encountered a few asking for money after few weeks chatting, 90% are asking for money.  Some the same person appearing with different names. There are also obscene pictures like posting with underwear, bare body. 
Hope tinder can look into it especially people who are asking money, we don‚Äôt know whether they are scammers, some women might just loose all their money."
tinder,sg,12.1.0,3,"Listen tinder you are showing me too many girls who are too popular and may have tens of thousands of messages in their in box! I don‚Äôt need these overrated normal girls who act like models, in the fore front of my swipe list! Even if I swipe continuously for 1000 times a day I still get these ‚Äúmodel girls‚Äù! Please show some normal girls, who are also pretty but are not overrated like this! You should have a feature called ‚Äúshow the next 10 thousand girls who are not so popular‚Äù! This is not a app to just see pretty girls! We need to match people who are suitable for us and that we actually have a chance with that‚Äôs why we are here!

Currently the way to get to less popular girls is to swipe a thousand times a day at least! But that ruins my elo score! Can we please have a middle ground solution to this! To get to the next batch of girls without needing to swipe 1000 times first and losing elo score. Not everyone is a dumb fool just trying to ‚Äúget lucky‚Äù with a girl who thinks she‚Äôs a model, come on man. 

Some of us use tinder as part of our dating strategy and we sure do hope that it could be better and on par with other apps at least! 

Let me tell you that I get more than 10 matches a day with pretty girls as well on Facebook dating who actually reply! And also on HelloTalk, the first girl that talked to me became my girl friend for 6 months and HelloTalk isn‚Äôt even a dating app! You guys are a dating app, and we can‚Äôt even get proper dates? Is tinder a joke? And what‚Äôs with the new platinum feature when Facebook dating is free and gets me more matches who actually reply? Come on man! To solve this issue just add a ‚Äúshow next batch of unpopular girls‚Äù! Thank you for your kind understanding!"
tinder,sg,11.31.0,5,"Hey tinder, I was viewing a profile and we were already chatting half way.

tinder,sg,11.28.0,1,"Forget about downloading this apps, the apps is full of china/hong kong/ taiwan ladies who keep pestering u for investment. If you ignore them, they report u on tinder apps, ended up account being banned. When u clarify with tinder help desk, they wouldnt listen to ur appeal. So guys... jus beware of this apps. Dun pay the subscription. Tinder will eat up eventually once yr account was randomly reported."
tinder,sg,11.28.0,1,"you would think that if your account was really problematic, Tinder would actually at least give you a warning to keep you in check, but no. I wasn't even close to breaking any of their guidelines or Terms of Service and I was banned all of a sudden from using Tinder after 2 years lmao.
The worse part is that they offer you a generic reason when you know that it isn't possible and that they do not accept appeals."
tinder,sg,11.28.0,3,"tinder is now filled with fake, trash, ugly, profiles in Singapore. this is coming from a 5 years user"

tinder,sg,11.28.0,1,I‚Äôve got banned for doing nothing wrong! I‚Äôm really disappointed in this
tinder,sg,11.28.0,1,"Most accounts are fake, or scammer. System should ensure authentication of the profile to make sure user experience."

tinder,sg,11.28.0,1,Account was banned within one month? I merely chatted wit a few ppl which was so simple. I don‚Äôt understand what was I ban for
tinder,sg,11.27.0,2,still get notifications from a match who (presumably) unmatched me? no idea how that is happening
tinder,sg,11.27.0,1,"I am so disappointed with Tinder and it‚Äôs support team, I was a paid member and had a gold subscription ‚Äònot even a month old‚Äô they have banned my account for no reason, I have sent multiple emails requesting for clarification which Tinder policy I have violated but I haven‚Äôt received a single response. Tinder team if you reading this, below are my 2 recent complaints 16972894 and 16967047, please do something to unlock my account. Thanks"
tinder,sg,11.27.0,1,"Hello, when will you completely fix all your problems???"
tinder,sg,12.1.0,1,The app is so laggy. Especially the chat feature
tinder,sg,12.1.0,1,Please update dark mode
tinder,sg,12.1.0,1,"It seems that Tinder does not try to improve and relies on reputation. Too bad, many other similar apps offer better quality and service. This one will not survive for long unless it changes."
tinder,sg,12.1.0,5,"I have encountered a few asking for money after few weeks chatting, 90% are asking for money.  Some the same person appearing with different names. There are also obscene pictures like posting with underwear, bare body. 
Hope tinder can look into it especially people who are asking money, we don‚Äôt know whether they are scammers, some women might just loose all their money."
tinder,sg,12.1.0,3,"Listen tinder you are showing me too many girls who are too popular and may have tens of thousands of messages in their in box! I don‚Äôt need these overrated normal girls who act like models, in the fore front of my swipe list! Even if I swipe continuously for 1000 times a day I still get these ‚Äúmodel girls‚Äù! Please show some normal girls, who are also pretty but are not overrated like this! You should have a feature called ‚Äúshow the next 10 thousand girls who are not so popular‚Äù! This is not a app to just see pretty girls! We need to match people who are suitable for us and that we actually have a chance with that‚Äôs why we are here!

Currently the way to get to less popular girls is to swipe a thousand times a day at least! But that ruins my elo score! Can we please have a middle ground solution to this! To get to the next batch of girls without needing to swipe 1000 times first and losing elo score. Not everyone is a dumb fool just trying to ‚Äúget lucky‚Äù with a girl who thinks she‚Äôs a model, come on man. 

Some of us use tinder as part of our dating strategy and we sure do hope that it could be better and on par with other apps at least! 

Let me tell you that I get more than 10 matches a day with pretty girls as well on Facebook dating who actually reply! And also on HelloTalk, the first girl that talked to me became my girl friend for 6 months and HelloTalk isn‚Äôt even a dating app! You guys are a dating app, and we can‚Äôt even get proper dates? Is tinder a joke? And what‚Äôs with the new platinum feature when Facebook dating is free and gets me more matches who actually reply? Come on man! To solve this issue just add a ‚Äúshow next batch of unpopular girls‚Äù! Thank you for your kind understanding!"
tinder,sg,11.31.0,5,"Hey tinder, I was viewing a profile and we were already chatting half way. And when I clicked into her information, tinder asked me again if I would like to stay connected with this person.

Please help me reconnect to her, I know in you can do something about it. Pleaseeeeee!!!"

tinder,sg,11.31.0,1,"Came across too many fake profiles, almost all impersonating, putting up fake profile pictures they‚Äôve got all over the internet. And even the function to report these fake profiles are buggy as after you‚Äôve reported certain numbers of fake profiles, it keeps telling you something is wrong with the system.

tinder,sg,11.30.0,1,Tinder recently full of Scammers try to scam you. Its such wasting your time trying to talk with real people. Tinder not doing anything to clean all of this fake profiles. Its so easy to spots them.
tinder,sg,11.30.0,1,is it just me or is the app extremely bug-gy.
tinder,sg,11.30.0,1,"My profile has nothing offensive on it. I was never disrespectful to the girls I‚Äôve matched with and out of no where, I got banned for no reason. Terrible app. Giving it one star is beyond generous."
tinder,sg,11.30.0,1,"Scam is everywhere:
- Chinese scams as they allow profiles without a picture
- Scams with dozen of profiles using the same fake pic
- You get matches but Facebook does not bring them up as they want you to pay for their atrociously expensive memberships
- Bugs preventing you from contacting matches while you had on-going discussions
In result a useless app that is only aimed at making you loose time or a lot of money"

tinder,sg,11.29.0,1,Would have rated zero stars if possible. Doesn‚Äôt read at all. Gets canned messages. I was banned at the stage of sign up. How do you violate guidelines when I can even use the app yet???? Can‚Äôt believe why there is anyone who even want to use the app. Guess it didn‚Äôt matter for a app with such a big database about 1 non paying not yet user being unhappy with them.
tinder,sg,11.29.0,1,"lots of fake profiles & china accounts asking for wechat and spamming, also was shadow banned for no reason rly a bad experience in general"

tinder,sg,11.27.0,1,"Hello, when will you completely fix all your problems???"
tinder,ie,12.2.0,1,"Never violated terms and conditions or user guidelines. Opened the app one day to a notification telling me I was banned. Customer Service basically just acknowledge you‚Äôre banned but won‚Äôt shine a light, and you can‚Äôt even appeal the decision.  Wouldn‚Äôt recommend, although it can pass the time, lifetime bans are around the corner."
tinder,ie,12.1.0,1,"Unbelievable banned for no reason, no explanation literally boom. Gone sorry, I think people deserve an explanation. Makes no sense"
tinder,ie,12.1.0,1,"Google Tinder banning people for no reason before using! It‚Äôs becoming a big problem for a lot of people and tinder will ignore all e-mails when they‚Äôre hit with logic and reason.  Ban is for life unless you change your number. Also, they advertise buying to match immediately. Half the people won‚Äôt actually message anyway so don‚Äôt waste your money!"

tinder,ie,12.1.0,1,"Constantly trying to get you to spend, or super like is beyond idiotic. The humans behind the algorithm must have very little to do if they think that this increases your chance of a match. How about asking prior instead of just updating the app with ridiculous novel ideas to line the corporate pockets"
tinder,ie,12.1.0,1,Banned for absolutely no reason at all. When I contacted customer service I got a generic reply telling me to read their terms and conditions again. Only used it for a couple of weeks and did not violate anything in their terms and conditions. I can‚Äôt understand it at all and their lack of customer service is shocking. If anyone else has experienced this please report the app and leave a review so they can hopefully do something about it.
tinder,ie,12.1.0,1,"Disgusting app keeps crashing. Extremely disappointed. Will cancel and delete if not solved.
Kiss my tuchus jerks."
tinder,ie,12.1.0,1,Shadowbanned and had previously spent a lot of money on tinder plus and gold. No way to resolve it. Just automated answers. Finished with this app and their dubious shoddy services.
tinder,ie,12.1.0,1,Attention seekers cunts with instagram links not interested to date. Should be banned.
tinder,ie,11.31.0,1,Totally unusable. Please fix
tinder,ie,11.31.0,1,Absolutely disgraceful.Shocking app very disappointing. I accidentally put in the wrong date of birth when signing up and it gave me no option to put it to the right age. I deleted it multiple times and downloaded it again but there was no change. DONT waste your time downloading this app it‚Äôs a SCAM a FRAUD and an overhyped piece of utter rubbish.
tinder,ie,11.31.0,1,"I like many other users I have seen in the reviews, got banned for no reason. I emailed their support and they offered no explanation at all. Disgrace of an app. So unfair on their users and so unhelpful."

tinder,ie,11.31.0,1,"Used Tinder for a few months . Woke up one morning to randomly discover I‚Äôd been ‚Äúbanned‚Äù . I‚Äôve never been rude on this app. Always put my best foot forward.

This company doesn‚Äôt deserve the profile it has , but considering it‚Äôs recently banned so many people , I suspect many other users will soon leave and move on to something better without this ridiculous policy and inability to appeal ."

tinder,ie,11.31.0,1,I can‚Äôt use this app without it lagging and being so slow to the point that it‚Äôs unbearable. Really disappointing considering I pay almost ‚Ç¨20 a month to use it.
tinder,ie,11.31.0,1,This is a scam. I deleted my account in November and I‚Äôm still being billed! Not very easy to unsubscribe which is what you need to do. Deleting your account is not enough!
tinder,ie,11.31.0,3,"app is crashing, did not load all my messages, freezing all the time"

tinder,ie,11.30.0,1,"By far the worst app (functionally) I‚Äôve used. It lags and freezes every single time you use it. It crashes frequently. If you exit the app and switch back in, it crashes. Very frustrating to use. Deleted and reinstalled, makes no difference."
tinder,ie,11.30.0,1,"Got banned for no reason, with no appeal process and no explanation as to the specifics of the ban.

tinder,ie,11.30.0,1,"Disgraceful service, surprised how an app this big is able to flourish with absolutely no respect for their consumers, myself and so many people have been banned and when you email they tell you that you violated their terms and conditions but will not allow you to appeal it, will not even tell you what you did wrong they basically say ‚Äúwe banned you, you can‚Äôt use your phone number or email with us ever again even if you‚Äôve spent money in our service and we are not even going to tell you why‚Äù like an absolute joke of a service, anyone experiencing the same issues I recommend for you to report the app so hopefully they get their act together"

tinder,ie,11.30.0,1,"Never did anything wrong on the app had normal pictures up, had nice conversations with people, got banned for absolutely no reason. I tried to email asking why and the response was an automated message that was no help at all. And now I can never make another account."

tinder,ie,11.29.0,1,"Worst app I‚Äôve ever experienced! I went on tinder to find true love and got banned for no reason in less than 24 hours.

I looked through my emails to see and tinder sent me no reason why and that I ‚Äúviolated community guidelines‚Äù but didn‚Äôt explain where.

I followed every procedure and made sure my profile was not in breach for any of the guidelines because I knew it was a serious app and was being sensible for other users.

There‚Äôs no point to using tinder if it‚Äôs just gonna ban someone without justifying it on the first place, it‚Äôs a disgrace."
tinder,ie,11.29.0,1,Never even made and account and im banned

tinder,ie,11.28.0,1,"App is so glitchy and even if you email customer service to alert them to the issues, they‚Äôll block your account."
tinder,ie,11.28.0,1,"Profit-driven company that will ban users without explanation, even after making them spend money to get any use out of their ‚Äúservice‚Äù. No recourse and no way to get back to using the service. 

Lost touch with potential connections and have no explanation at all for what earned my account a ban. 

The result was that I became socially cut-off from the rest of the world during a pandemic and tried committing suicide, because I had nobody to talk to. Funny how that works out, huh?"
tinder,ie,11.28.0,2,Tinder is okay in my opinion I think the app needs a huge up date some thing to bring more people Attention my self I am looking for friends put it‚Äôs hard when the app has no fun to it like games to get to know people

I looked into it online and a lot of people had the same issue when They got banned and they don't know why no reason is given. Some people say that a simple report can get you banned.

The other problem is Asian fake profiles . I matched with one who made up crap about making money on bitcoin"

tinder,ie,11.23.0,2,Keeps showing people outside of the radius limit you set which is very annoying
tinder,ie,11.23.0,1,Paid for tinder gold but then discovery wouldn‚Äôt work - now I can‚Äôt even download the app!!
tinder,ie,11.23.0,1,"Why does it omit Iran from countrys list??? We can‚Äôt sign in with Iran‚Äôs phone number and other ways doesn‚Äôt work!!!
Tinder has lots of users in Iran. This is not respectful."
tinder,ie,11.23.0,1,"Banned for no reason as I did nothing wrong, when I questioned them about this they said can‚Äôt be appealed and can‚Äôt give a reason why I was banned (there is no reason why). 
Shocking service"
tinder,ie,11.23.0,1,"I can‚Äôt talk to anyone on tinder even I have matched a lot of people, they are all robots"
tinder,ie,11.23.0,1,"no coochie to be seen , smh"
tinder,ie,11.23.0,1,"I set up a new account yesterday and it seems to be broken. Initially it was fine, however after I finished editing my profile there‚Äôs no one on the discovery page?? Discovery is enabled and I payed for 6 months of Tinder Plus which I can‚Äôt use now. Help please!!"
tinder,ie,11.22.0,1,no cute Irish lads
tinder,ie,11.22.0,3,"Think the addition of the ‚ÄòPassions‚Äô section is a good idea, but so strange the options differ depending on where you live ü§î Maybe if there was a huge difference in cultures that‚Äôd make sense, but people in London can choose Nightlife and festivals, and I can‚Äôt in Dublin? Bizarre"
tinder,ie,11.22.0,1,They just have me permanently banned for no reason lol
tinder,ie,11.22.0,4,"So Ive thought of a new idea that deffo should be a feature of tinder. So like a 30 to 60 second video introduction of oneself. You get to see they are who they are, can hear them talk and get a grasp of their personality. Like maybe it can show their skill or just an introduction. Please put this in action üòÇ I‚Äôve been single forever and apps aren‚Äôt doing anything so far. Need something fresh and different. Thanks."
tinder,ie,11.22.0,1,"Have tinder Gold, can‚Äôt swipe on my likes keeps saying failure to match. Not getting anymore matches or likes and won‚Äôt let me see who‚Äôs nearby to em no matter how far I stretch the distance on who to swipe. This has happened a few times in the last couple months with my account. Have submit a report with the app and haven‚Äôt any response?"
tinder,ie,11.21.0,1,Literally downloaded the app and logged signed up with Facebook then left the app no matches didn‚Äôt even swipe anyone and when I went to use it my account was blocked..... definitely NEVER RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!!
tinder,ie,11.21.0,1,"The app is just broken. No one is showing up in my discovery. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs on global or not or what age, distance or city is set. Tried deleting the app, account and logging out. No profiles to swipe on no matter what I try."
tinder,ie,11.20.0,1,"There was a surge of fake and empty profiles. That's very concerning since you are exposed to creeps that are only voyering to say the least, since their true agenda is unknown -- no photo and no name? Who in the sane mind would match them? That is starting to make this social network very dangerous to those who are using the app to connect with other normal people unless Tinder starts to ban those profiles."
tinder,ie,11.19.0,1,"Paid for 6 months subscription upfront, account was banned for no reason, no explanation given and no option for appeals process. Absolute theft. Shameful that apple allows Apple Pay for a service that steals your money."
tinder,ie,11.19.0,1,"Paid fee As requested, now looking for more money mmmmmm !"
tinder,ie,11.19.0,1,"Yes shadow banned is a thing...Youtube it, they will take your money but your waaaaay down on the list (even if you boost)...I noticed I would go from 20+ likes per boost to 0 or maybe 1 (after a year on tinder)...why? There are many theories, from to many soft resets to being reported for any reason..but this company will take your hard earned money and  not provide you with the service your paying for...that's called a scam"
tinder,ie,11.19.0,2,"The app is otherwise bugless, however messages are sending duplicates, or telling me they are sent and never actually being delivered. Redownloading hasn‚Äôt seemed to fix this problem"
tinder,ie,11.19.0,3,i found my dad on here
tinder,ie,11.19.0,3,"I love the app but within a week I‚Äôve come into a really annoying problem of chats disappearing forever with no chance of getting it back. Happened once yesterday after I tapped on the notification of a new message, leading me to, well nothing. The person was gone. Again today I woke up to a new match notification and a notification of a message from a new person. Presumably the match and message were the same person. However after tapping on the notification and being brought to the app, the new match and new message were nowhere to be found. Redownloading the app doesn‚Äôt help either :/"
tinder,ie,11.19.0,5,Couldn‚Äôt rate this app enough! Unbelievable to say the least! Met my boyfriend on here a year ago and we are still going strong to this day... I often see him swiping other girls so that just shows how much he loved the app!! Well done tinder thanks so much.
tinder,ie,11.18.0,1,Keeps saying I have no one around me even when I adjust the distance !!!!!!
tinder,ie,11.18.0,1,"Banned due to age restrictions which is false as I am over 18 
Sent age verification and still hasn‚Äôt let me back in 
I need this fixed"
tinder,ie,11.18.0,3,Not working on iPhone 5s
tinder,ie,11.18.0,1,I‚Äôm disappointed. I had a feeling that my significant other was using this app even we supposedly supposed to be exclusive. I say the notification pop with the flaming logo that burns right into my retinas a few months ago. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I made the connection to the illustration of flames to the reason behind this app. Our relationship predates this sort of hook up or dating app by at least 5 years. I can only say I‚Äôm distraught and dismayed
tinder,ie,11.18.0,1,I have used tinder for a a month or more I had 7 likes up so I decided to get a subscription to find out as usual with these dating apps when you buy a subscription all the likes are narrowed down I fancied someone and when I went to like her back to match she disappeared off the screen so I wasn‚Äôt surprised with that it‚Äôs a joke .beware paying money to these con artists.
tinder,ie,11.18.0,1,i downloaded it last night and woke up to being banned
tinder,ie,11.18.0,1,I went back on this when I found out you could change locations to view others internationally and I was glad that was there I went of it for two months to come back and see this bs to pay a fee just to change locations.  Greedy as hell
tinder,ie,11.18.0,1,"Every single time I make a normal profile with fully clothed regular pics I get banned within a week, completely normal bio, linked to Spotify and instagram, verified pictures all banned within days. I‚Äôve completely given up, gone through 4 accounts in 2 months... their customer service is an even bigger joke."
tinder,ie,11.18.0,1,Banned for being transgender. What is this about? It‚Äôs 2020.
tinder,ie,11.17.0,1,"Honestly don‚Äôt even bother.

They banned my account within 2 hours of making it for seemingly no reason. They made a vague reference to community guidelines, but were unable to tell me which guidelines I had violated (none). 

Their customer service appears to be fully automated, as the replies to my emails kept repeating themselves over and over, saying they take community guidelines seriously but failed to answer my questions or queries.

Furthermore, they don‚Äôt even have an appeals process. Once they ban you, you‚Äôre essentially banned for life. (Unless you get a new number, which of course doesn‚Äôt make sense).

Very discriminatory in my opinion that I am not given a reason for this action, and not even allowed to appeal the decision."
tinder,ie,11.16.0,5,My account got banned and I don‚Äôt know why would you mind explaining to me why that is
tinder,ie,11.16.0,5,My good friend dan got the feek cause of u fair play
tinder,ie,11.16.0,1,"One star for the recent addition of TIPS on your profile. ‚ÄúA smile will get more likes‚Äù or ‚Äúditch the selfie‚Äù these are tips Tinder gives you, and this is SO wrong. Let people make their profiles and express themselves shut your advice up. Like literally what do you know about who someone is or who they‚Äôre looking for. Obviously Tinder can make statistics around these things but just because a certain type of profile gets the most matches doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs better. People are who they are and their profile should reflect this. I cannot believe this idea of tips is actually in the app. However that happened shows their are people at Tinder who do not understand what their app is. Five star app otherwise but this is screwed up"
tinder,ie,11.15.0,3,"App freezes everytime I go into it, gets new notifications about new matches and messages yet I can‚Äôt see them. Freezes everytime I try and type a message"
tinder,ie,11.15.0,1,I can‚Äôt post pics of vids of my arms but girls can post provocative pictures and not get them taken down for being inappropriate. Nice one lads yeah
tinder,ie,11.15.0,2,Nearly always crashes on start up and i don‚Äôt know how i can fix it
tinder,ie,11.15.0,1,Constantly looking for verification and only works on 4G and not on WiFi. Needs work.
tinder,ie,11.15.0,2,"This app is very slow when swiping, the longer you stay on it the slower it gets. It‚Äôs very annoying, it used to be smooth"
tinder,ie,11.14.0,2,"Was banned without any warnings whatsoever, for no apparent reason. Had no inappropriate images, was always very nice and polite, was just like any user. Not only is there no appeals process, I cannot make a new account. Very pay to win app this is aswell. Not satisfied at all"
tinder,ie,11.13.0,1,"Hope this helps someone else. I‚Äôve been a Plus subscriber with Tinder since about 2016. I‚Äôve had a wonderful time. The app always seemed fair, and I met tons of new people online and in real life by using it. I became a Plus subscriber to get past the daily limit of matches you could make. I liked to spend a decent amount of time on Tinder so it made sense for me.

Now though, things have changed. Their monetization teams has clearly taken a more restrictive stance. Where I would average 20-30 matches per day back in 2016-2017, today, I‚Äôm lucky to get 3. This is such a dramatic decrease that it in no way could be my profile. 

It seems that the introduction of gold and superboosts seem to drive their monetization efforts. Tinder is clearly trying to make it as frustrating as possible for both standard and premium members to get matches, in order to push their in app purchases of boosts.

While boosts were a fantastic idea and I loved them, they didn‚Äôt use to be necessary to have a good time on Tinder. Now they are. I‚Äôll be ceasing my subscription with Tinder. As a paying member, I don‚Äôt see the point. 1 free boost a month is not worth it to me. I don‚Äôt want more free boosts

I just want a more natural matching algorithm like it used to be. 

I‚Äôll have to try a competitor. I hope others heed this advice and recognise that paying for plus or gold is a waste of time. If you really want to, pay for boosts only. They‚Äôre the only thing that works. But be warned, the days after you‚Äôll go back to getting 3 matches."
tinder,ie,11.13.0,1,"Banned me 2 days after I downloaded the app, I emailed support but they wouldn‚Äôt tell me why I was banned, I know I didn‚Äôt breach any terms and conditions nor did I breach community guidelines, wouldn‚Äôt let me rejoin either"
tinder,ie,11.13.0,1,"Very disappointed to discover that banning process on tinder seems to be unmoderated with no facility to appeal. It seems that other tinder members can decide to ban you without the intervention of tinder employees. As someone who was paying for the service, I am both surprised and Disappointed."
tinder,ie,11.13.0,1,I updated it and now it won‚Äôt open at all.....
tinder,ie,11.12.0,2,I have to close the app twice before I can unmatch someone please change this secondly there has been an influx of people using passport and it‚Äôs kind of annoying because I only want to see people near but the distance feature doesn‚Äôt work so please give us the option to select whether we want to view people on passport or not
tinder,ie,11.12.0,1,It has ruined the app experience. Scrolling through tons of people who are everywhere now. I‚Äôll have to stop using while this ‚Äògift‚Äô keeps on giving. If you want to give a free feature for during this time you could have thought more about it
tinder,ie,11.12.0,1,Please stop making the Passport free. The area is now full of people who dont live here. Makes it completely unusable. Thanks
tinder,ie,11.12.0,3,The app is great but honestly there are some many bugs around. Every now and then I have to force close the app due to a bug or because the chats simply don‚Äôt refresh. It‚Äôs quite slow at times as well. So we lose a lot of potential because nobody wants to use the app regularly cuz it‚Äôs too bad to talk and so on.
tinder,ie,11.12.0,1,"Been on it for over 2 years but never met anyone, are there even any real people on it?!.. Absolutely rubbish and a waste of time, filled with fake people and scammers"
tinder,ie,11.12.0,2,What are you doing Tinder! Every second person is now 7000km away because you made it free. Swiping is absolutely pointless. Nobody wants to match with people miles away. Please turn the free passport off. Please!
tinder,ie,11.11.1,1,Not impressed seeing as I didn‚Äôt use it for 2 months and when I went to check in on it I was banned ???? Had no reason to ban me and now they won‚Äôt unban me for doing nothing wrong. Not impressed.
tinder,ie,11.11.0,1,"The app doesn‚Äôt work 80-90 percent of the time, I have to continuously open and close the app multiple times before it works, it freezes all the time and it‚Äôs not my phone, there‚Äôs no point charging 17 euros for an app that doesn‚Äôt work, it makes no sense, and now I can‚Äôt even reply messages. Trash"
tinder,ie,11.10.4,3,"Can someone help. My messages aren‚Äôt sending anymore. And it‚Äôs not cuz someone might have unmatched it‚Äôs literally when I try and respond to anyone an alert pops up at the top of my screen that says ‚Äúerror message cannot send‚Äù something like that. Not a connection issue because WiFi is fine.
Appreciate any help.
Thanks"
tinder,ie,11.10.4,2,"so glitchy , always tells me i have notifications when i don‚Äôt"
tinder,ie,11.10.4,1,"Works for two days and then it doesn‚Äôt. Even if you pay, nothing helps. It‚Äôs as close to a scam as you can get. You might say it is a scam actually."
tinder,ie,11.9.0,2,App keeps crashing every second time I‚Äôm opening it. It‚Äôs also extremely slow
tinder,ie,11.9.0,1,"Basically don‚Äôt match with anyone unless you pay for premium, premium is unbelievably expensive and even after you pay for premium you eventually don‚Äôt get any matches unless you start paying for the boosts joke of an app I‚Äôd recommend just going out and meeting someone rather then using this"
tinder,ie,11.8.0,1,"EVERYTIME i go in the app crashes, or deletes all my messages, so annoying to see the notification that someone‚Äôs messages you but not be able to read it"
tinder,ie,11.8.0,1,The app keeps logging me out for no reason...
tinder,ie,11.7.2,3,I used to get top picks on tinder and since I re downloaded it I don‚Äôt anymore?
tinder,ie,11.6.1,2,When I exit the app and return to my homescreen the app crashes and I can‚Äôt open it again. I need to delete and redownload the app to use it. Needs to be fixed
tinder,ie,11.6.0,1,Crashes constantly every few swipes! Iphone 7 ios 13.3
tinder,ie,11.6.0,5,"Sick of the app force closing itself. I pay for premium and get a crap app. The idea of it is great but the app is slow, it takes ages for things to load no matter how strong my WiFi or 4G signal is and then freezes either forcing me to close it or completely closing itself. Really disappointed."
tinder,ie,11.6.0,1,"Worst app I‚Äôve ever paid for , can‚Äôt scroll and it glitches out right away"
tinder,ie,11.5.0,4,"Good basic dating app. Only has an advantage because it was one of the first on the market, others eg Bumble make people answer questions on their profiles and there‚Äôs a better way to get an insight into personality. Not much to judge off here other than short bio. Could do with some innovation to stay relevant"
tinder,ie,11.4.0,1,Have to pay to see who swiped right which is stupid & the prices are outrages to start with u should be able to see who swiped right for free fix it or your gonna lose alot of users because of it. Thats my opinion tbh
tinder,ie,11.3.0,1,"This app has so much bugs it‚Äôs incredible. My profile showing 32 new messages yet zero actual messages when I click in to it. Had a message from one girl that only delivered when I uninstalled and reinstalled the app three days later. Lads you‚Äôre making a killing from this app, at least invest in some good programmers to maintain this bug ridden mess."
tinder,ie,11.3.0,1,App Miss-Sells itself and just scams you out of your money!!!
tinder,ie,11.2.1,1,i put in my phone number and it  wont log me in
tinder,ie,11.2.1,1,App just keeps crashing it rarely lets me actually access it then when I do it‚Äôs so slow fix this !!
tinder,ie,11.1.1,1,"Have to close and reopen the app each time I get a new message. Or it says I have new matches / messages when I don't. Or even more unforgivable, it says my messages have sent to my matches, when in fact they never receive them. Cancelling my subscription and not renewing it again. Scam"
tinder,ie,11.1.0,2,"When I receive messages, I am notified that I have them but they do not appear under the correct person. I have to click into random names to reply to a message from a different person. Furthermore it doesn‚Äôt display all the chats I have with people and I have to go through my matches to find our chats. Very very annoying please fix soon."
tinder,ie,11.0.1,3,"My app keeps crashing and won‚Äôt load, this is unfortunate as I‚Äôve payed for tinder gold"
tinder,ie,11.0.1,5,"I want my money back
Give back my money please"
tinder,ie,11.0.0,2,"Love the app but it‚Äôs ruining poorly on my iPhone 6 with frequent crashes and stuttering 
The most recent update however has made the app unusable. The app crashes before it can load needs looking into"
tinder,ie,10.20.0,3,"Everytime I leave the app, it signs me out and when I sign back in, I lose all my matches. I have to delete the app, reinstall it just to get back all my matches to carry on chatting with someone... it never seems to work properly"
tinder,ie,10.20.0,1,"Despite having location turned on, this App constantly locating me me around 50km from where I‚Äôm actually located!"
tinder,ie,10.19.1,1,"Joined for first time , paid for tinder plus , next day banned and no explanation , i‚Äôve never had a cross word with anybody , no refund , surely this is not right ???

Never been on it before so im gobsmacked how i got banned 

Stay away"
tinder,ie,10.19.1,1,Met a creep
tinder,ie,10.18.0,1,"App crashes at least twice every time I open the app. So frustrating, takes me roughly two minutes to just get onto the app. Then once I get on it takes ages to load. This deters me from going on the app to be honest. It is so frustrating, wish they would just fix it. 

Also every time you reply to someone it brings you the whole way back to the very top of your messages but I have unanswered messages which are very far down so I have to scroll the whole way back down again!üò™"
tinder,ie,10.18.0,2,"From about Aug-19, the app immediately crashes  it will open when re-downloaded for one time only."
tinder,ie,10.17.0,3,"I found my coworker on here gonna be awkward Monday morning, swiped right to be nice"
tinder,ie,10.17.0,1,Spending days swiping trying to match people who liked me ridiculous
tinder,ie,10.17.0,4,"Tinder is very good for looking for people to either date or chat, people are nice to chat to. Only thing I would say is to have more likes instead of running out and waiting 12 hours can be frustrating but for me this deserves a 4.5  ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
tinder,ie,10.17.0,1,"Nothing but a female ego booster, don‚Äôt expect a reply for any of the people using it will just get ignored."
tinder,ie,10.17.0,5,"You get out of tinder how much you put into it, I had to go on a dates with different people before I met my boyfriend, we are together nearly a year now and he is amazing, you‚Äôd be a fool to be single in 2019 and not to give tinder a good try"
tinder,ie,10.17.0,3,The new update does not connect to Instagram account.
tinder,ie,10.17.0,5,"Until I met the love of my life on my first ever tinder date, 8 months ago now!"
tinder,ie,10.17.0,5,Very good worth your while to give it a try
tinder,ie,10.17.0,1,It‚Äôs absolutely terrible.
tinder,ie,10.17.0,1,Prices are ridiculous. Total rip off!
tinder,ie,10.17.0,1,"Matches never reply, and white girls are not much into black guys"
tinder,ie,10.17.0,5,I already wrote a goddamn review
tinder,ie,10.17.0,3,"A lot of fake profiles, men all claiming to be in the country when they are not. I‚Äôm not sure what they are looking for but you can tell by their pics as they are always professionally done photos."
tinder,ie,10.17.0,1,"No one talks, ego stroking app. 0/10"
tinder,ie,10.17.0,3,Considering the cost the fact that it doesn‚Äôt work when not connected to WiFi is really bad.
tinder,ie,10.17.0,1,My tinder doesn‚Äôt work properly
tinder,ie,10.17.0,1,Telling me I‚Äôve messages when I don‚Äôt it needs to be sorted out and seriously having to pay for read receipts is a joke
tinder,ie,10.17.0,3,"The app crashes a lot.
Charging for read receipts is a bit of a joke.
No vetting of fake profiles."
tinder,ie,10.16.0,1,"What a waste of money. I‚Äôve paid for a Tinder Gold plan and when I try to restore my purchase it says it‚Äôs already tied to another account although I only ever had one. Worst part? The support, they reply if and or when and have no phone number. What a waste of ‚Ç¨140. I have emailed them about 10 times with the same steps over and over again after advising I‚Äôve already done the steps with no luck. Shame on you Tinder"
tinder,ie,10.16.0,1,"I like the app, the layout, but please it seems the app has never been tested before releasing.. there are major bugs in there which gets the app just annoying."
tinder,ie,10.15.1,4,Logged out and lost all my matches and messages
tinder,ie,10.15.1,3,"If you purchase tinder gold then delete your account, you still get charged the next month, I don‚Äôt understand this. Other than that, the app is pretty good. But that‚Äôs sad to see that it‚Äôs so easy to buy something but not to unsubscribe,"
tinder,ie,10.14.0,2,Really annoying to use. Not worth the extra money. Location services runs my battery down to nothing and it rarely works without it. My phone keeps freezing and I have to spend ages unlocking it via Siri and shutting down etc. Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the money considering how glitchy it is.
tinder,ie,10.13.0,1,"1. Los primeros d√≠as que la usas muy bien 2. Despu√©s la cosa cambia y para que aparezca algo que te guste tienes que swipe varias veces nope. Lo que te implica destinar m√°s tiempo en la app. 
3. Finamente la cosa va a peor y lo podr√≠a comparar con abrir el cubo de la basura y empezar a sacar restos. Hay im√°genes que son incluso desagradables, como una barriga grande llena de pelo, sin m√°s. Y lo peor es que es una detr√°s de otra sin parar, lo que implica que tengas que destinar mucho tiempo a ver cosas que no te van a gustar para encontrar algo un poco decente. 
4. Esto parece ser que se arreglar√≠a con una suscripci√≥n que cuesta 21.99 eur/mes. La cual considero cara e in√∫til y ahora explicar√© porque. 
5. Tener matches no es equivalente a conversaciones o citas. Ya que Tinder tiene muchos usuarios que no tienen intenci√≥n de buscar nada. 
-Hay personas casadas que solo curiosean. 
-Chic@s que solo cazan para tener una lista de ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù y ya. 
-Otros que son demasiado perezosos para mantener una conversaci√≥n. 
-Los burnout (como yo) que estamos cansad@s de entrar y salir de Tinder pero quiz√°s matamos el tiempo ‚ÄúCazando Pok√©mons‚Äù ya que hacerlo en un bar se ha vuelto en una MI. 
6. Millones de fallos en el chat cuando consigues mantener alguna conversaci√≥n.
Como que se cambie la conversaci√≥n que mantienes con alguien, a otro usuario con otras fotos y genera mil de confusi√≥n. 
Que no lleguen los mensajes que envias..."
tinder,ie,10.13.0,1,"Banned me for life because I put ‚ÄòI‚Äôm basically 10‚Äô in my bio. Yeah, don‚Äôt mess about with age, because they take it seriously, but this is totally ridiculous. Tried to appeal it, but I‚Äôve actually been told I have been BANNED FOR LIFE. But the app was quite a pleasant experience from the 5 minutes I had on it..."
tinder,ie,10.13.0,1,"App isn‚Äôt functional . I swipe on 1 person, fine, I swipe on the second, and then it undoes the first and second swipe. 

I‚Äôm a paid customer and this is horrible, nowhere on the app to even report or ask for help."
tinder,ie,10.13.0,1,Says 17+ for age I put my age as 17 and tinder ban my account absolute joke
tinder,ie,10.12.1,2,Can someone please contact me as soon as possible? I am getting bills from yee but am not using your site at all? My number is 0860421066.
tinder,ie,10.12.1,1,"This app does not have a customer support despite making millions.
I have contacted them 4 times. First time 8 days ago. Not a single reply. Just an automated email. Paid 88‚Ç¨ and can't use what I paid for. Avoid."
tinder,ie,10.12.1,1,"Been using tinder for a while and I soemtimes delete my account when I meet a guy then make a new one. Made a new one and after doing the bio and pics I clicked off the app. When I clicked back on, BOOM, banned for no reason. My pics werent even riskay and my bio wasnt bad atall. When I contacted support they basically said yeah you're banned sorry about it, no appeals. Totally unfair and bumble it is boys and girls. ü§òüèª I'm just glad I didn't pay for it. Be careful."
tinder,ie,10.11.0,1,"I wish there was a more serious side, instead of defaulting to swiping with no results.

Bought Gold and bonus super likes, but there is no reason to buy them. Cause, it doesn‚Äôt add any new matches that results into dates.

I feel like there are a load of fake profiles, and for it to be more tailored by location/age that what it provides today. There should be more incentive to meetup for users, but tinder doesn‚Äôt do that very well.

Don‚Äôt waste your time nor money, go meet outside of online dating. It‚Äôs strictly supplemental to normal dating."
tinder,ie,10.11.0,1,App literally just doesn‚Äôt work
tinder,ie,10.10.1,1,Very disappointed with the login since update. Keeps making me sign back in?? And SMS won‚Äôt send to my phone!!
tinder,ie,10.10.0,1,"Stay away as constantly freezing and having to delete account . Sign up and again same problem. Terrible customer service and wanted a refund pushed back to apple and all I got was they determined not did it meet criteria so no refund.

Should have know with reviews before."
tinder,ie,10.9.1,5,Keeps logging me out everytime I close the app
tinder,ie,10.9.1,3,When I‚Äôm listening to music through my earphones the music stops playing every few minutes which is very unappealing and nearly has me closing the app. I love tinder I just feel this problem should be fixed seen as the ads are only pictures my music shouldn‚Äôt stop playing. I think it happens whenever someone has a video on their profile aswell which gets irritating. I hope you resolve this soon. Thanks
tinder,ie,10.9.0,1,"I got banned for no reason so I emailed the costumer support with information and just got a pre written computer response. 
Would not recommend."
tinder,ie,10.5.0,1,"Recently decided to give tinder a go, out of boredom mostly. Kept asking for my phone number to log in every time which only worked sometimes. Then I got banned and have no idea why cause I can't see any terms I've broken."
tinder,ie,10.5.0,1,App crashes when asked to verify phone number
tinder,ie,10.5.0,1,Have to wait 11 hours to swipe right on a few decent lads can‚Äôt do that now not happy with this feature
tinder,ie,10.5.0,1,If you‚Äôre not willing to get tinder gold don‚Äôt bother that‚Äôs the only way you‚Äôll get anywhere just don‚Äôt bother with this app anyway it‚Äôs practically just a female ego booster at this point ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
tinder,ie,10.4.1,1,"I‚Äôve spent money on unlimited swipes but after a while it just gets stuck looking for matches. Change location, still nothing. It happens all the time and sometimes you have to wait hours before it starts working again.

I have tried it on pc with a lan connection, relogged in and still nothing."
tinder,ie,10.4.1,1,i‚Äôve been banned from the app for no reason at all and there is no form of customer service since the only satisfaction you can get is an automated response on email. i‚Äôve seen all over google that error 40303 and banning is an issue for loads of people and that there is no one on tinder‚Äôs end to actually explain why the banning is happening. it‚Äôs not fair to not know what was done wrong.
tinder,ie,10.4.1,1,"I had tinder gold and suddenly I was logged out and couldn‚Äôt get back into my profile, this was infuriating and after many times trying to contact tinder to no avail I decided to give the app another try, when I paid for my second subscription it automatically renewed my old accounts subscription without telling me any of this so now I have a subscription to which I can‚Äôt avail, the app is great but the support is practically useless! Hope this issue gets addressed soon"
tinder,ie,10.4.1,2,"The text verification won‚Äôt send at all, so I have to verify with email. Email doesn‚Äôt send for three hours. Then I finally get in and my age is set as 23, (I‚Äôm 18) and I can‚Äôt change it. My FaceBook has my correct age so that‚Äôs not the problem. Very bad experience :/"
tinder,ie,10.4.0,2,"All my matches disappeared and tinder doesn‚Äôt work,after paying for gold this is an absolute joke"
tinder,ie,10.4.0,1,bans for no reason ??
tinder,ie,10.4.0,1,"I recently bought tinder gold in September for a year it was 48.99 , I changed my phone number but the account associated with the old number has locked me out I cannot receive verification codes and I have sent them endless emails asking for help and every single one has been ignored, Utterly disappointed and seeing as they have no live support or phone number lines too ring I can not get talking too them any other way! Very unhappy customer and I will be telling people about my experience I hope this comes back too bite them as a company like this should not have such terrible customer service!"
tinder,ie,10.3.0,1,For some reason my app has updated to what seems to be a lot older version of the app... Feed is gone and for some reason my profile went from 9 to 6 pictures even though there‚Äôs somehow 7 but can‚Äôt do anything with that one picture plus picture quality has turned really bad for whatever reason... Dunno whether or not this is an update or not but please sort as everything looks ancient now feels like I‚Äôve a Nokia rather than an iPhone
tinder,ie,10.3.0,5,Been with my TINDER bf 6 monthsüòçüòçüòç
tinder,ie,10.3.0,1,"So basically what happened was I just bought Tinder Gold and used it for a while, decided to change my location to see people from different countries and it kicked me out and then completely got me out of my account, asking for my number. I put my current number in, the one I bought Tinder Gold with and it made me start a new account. Basically I spend my money and my account disappeared. Contact me somehow so we can sort this out, because my money just got scammed."
tinder,ie,10.3.0,5,I just want to thank this app that made me meet my one. The person who makes me happy and cares for me. Little did I know when I downloaded the app that I would be so happy afterwards.
tinder,ie,10.2.0,1,Keeps deleting my accounts for no reason despite me paying for tinder gold. And when asked about it I don‚Äôt get An answer. I‚Äôm raging.
tinder,ie,10.2.0,2,I‚Äôve emailed the apple store I want to cancel my subscription can someone please let me know how to ?
tinder,ie,10.1.1,1,Anytime I swipe right I get a can‚Äôt connect error and haven‚Äôt matched with anyone in ages. Also can‚Äôt seem to be able to lodge a complaint anywhere!!!
tinder,ie,10.0.0,4,"Hi you have a bug in your iOS client, on swiping left on an advert profile with video content the sound resumes playing until the app is put into the background or closed."
tinder,ie,9.8.1,1,This is my 3rd time advising of my problem trying to update my pictures and info. Once I click edit info it keeps freezing and won‚Äôt let me update anything or use the app until it‚Äôs close. I have tried logging out and back in and no luck. Any hope of ye actually reading this and getting it sorted?
tinder,ie,9.8.1,1,"So I keep being logged out, using my phone number to log back in. But every now and again I‚Äôm being made create a new account, even though there is one already registered with my phone number AND tinder gold. 

This is honestly a joke."
tinder,ie,9.8.0,1,Almost every time I try to go into the account I‚Äôve been logged out and have to get a new text code to sign in every time. More hassle than it‚Äôs worth. Also don‚Äôt see the point in offering a ‚ÄúPlaces‚Äù feature if I‚Äôve literally been the same places several times a week for the last few weeks and it still has no regular places for me?
tinder,ie,9.8.0,1,"My tinder isn‚Äôt allowing me to login, and this is a new phone so I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going wrong"
tinder,ie,9.8.0,3,It‚Äôs showing 17 messages but there is no 17 messages
tinder,ie,9.8.0,1,"Tinder forced me to put my phone number, share location and facebook account. Whats next? You want also to know how much i make and send you nudes????
This is absurd and i must give my data to log into an app!!!!
And whats with the fake notifications?"
tinder,ie,9.7.2,1,"I recently downloaded the app for the second time, after a day of using I was banned but was informed of this so emailed support to ask why I couldn‚Äôt log in. They told me I was banned but refused to tell me why and when I asked to if I could appeal the ban they said they had no system of doing that. I look at the terms of service and I‚Äôd broken no rules. They should really give a warning before banning cause they are losing a lot of users this way. Also even when using the app, a lot of the time it crashes when opening the app and can only be fixed by reinstalling the app."
tinder,ie,9.7.2,2,"I may be late to this party but ‚Äúrunning out of likes‚Äù because I don‚Äôt pay you is positively idiotic and ridiculous.
You can do better. Be better."

tinder,ie,9.5.0,1,Banned for no reason after being harassed for a week by another user ? When I emailed them after finally replying refused to help... wouldn‚Äôt download it ever again not safe and they do NOT look out for their users! shame! Trying Bumble instead seems great so far üëå
tinder,ie,9.5.0,5,"Help my tinder account has never worked properly for me, when i login with my phone number it opens the app sometimes it‚Äôs works but mostly is doesn‚Äôt keeps saying something went wrong check ur internet connection, but I‚Äôve great internet so i don‚Äôt no wats wrong please help, ps and it‚Äôs not letting me log out keeps saying there‚Äôs a problem try later"
tinder,ie,9.5.0,1,My profile was deleted for no apparent reason I only ever swiped right for people I was genuinely interested in and after getting to know a lovely man I was shocked to try and log on and to find out my account has been deleted for violating community guidelines and I can never get it back! I have heard a lot of people in the trans community talking about their accounts being deleted also it is silly
tinder,ie,9.5.0,1,"It‚Äôs not really dating hear, there more like pen pals üò•üò•. They blocked my account without informing me of any breach or even to check if my account had been hacked. Instead the took the easy way out and accused me of doing something wrong, not willing to show any proof and I know for a fact that I done nothing."
tinder,ie,9.5.0,1,"I joined this app on the advise of friends to meet someone cos it‚Äôs ‚Äútinder‚Äù. Generally this site is a step away from an advertised legalised ‚Äúhook up‚Äù site. The hopes of meeting genuine people are slim. But if live outside a city forget it...
It‚Äôs just an unrealistic site. If you truly want to meet someone forget the thoughts of tinder"
tinder,ie,9.5.0,5,"What stared off as a swipe to the right ...ended up as the most beautiful relationship I‚Äôve ever been in and one I want to stay in forever. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it took a few awful dates, there‚Äôs some weird people on this who I regret meeting , but I‚Äôve found the one! 
Let your adventure start here..."

tinder,ie,9.4.0,1,I used this app before and thought it was a good way to meet new people but I logged out of my account and every time I try to make another one it doesn‚Äôt let me and it just makes me repeat the whole steps or it says errror like seriously needs to be fixed or something...
tinder,ie,9.3.0,1,I was actually enjoying using the app but I got blocked. Now I can‚Äôt even make a new account because I was removed for no reason. Customer support is a joke as they haven‚Äôt responded to me in days. I don‚Äôt even know why I was removed. I should have been told the reason why my account was deleted. I‚Äôm really annoyed and really suggest you don‚Äôt download this app. The cost of becoming a tinder gold member is ridiculously high and why would you pay if they‚Äôre just going to terminate your account without any warning. I‚Äôm so annoyed.
tinder,ie,9.3.0,1,The app runs out of likes too quickly I think it's terrible that you then have to wait a whole day before liking again it won't let you see who likes you which is annoying how am I going to find a match but I could forgive all that if it actually worked the app logs me out of my account constantly I try to login again and I end up having to make a new account truly awful experience worst thing is they haven't even done anything to fix it would not recommend
tinder,ie,9.3.0,5,"I can‚Äôt create an account, it gives me the option to log in with Facebook but it also asks for my phone number and then I never receive the code.."
tinder,ie,9.3.0,5,"Joined it for a few rides and got Tinder Premium about 18 months ago. Met a good few girls off it, one turned out to be incredible, swiped her for a laugh and currently 6 months together. Don‚Äôt knock it till ya try it"

tinder,ie,8.10.0,1,No one of interest in my area.
tinder,ie,8.10.0,2,Freezes and logs out too often and extremely annoying how it asks you to review after every match etc
tinder,ie,8.10.0,3,"The app works as you'd expect it to, but there are many features which you have to pay for, and the price being asked is silly. It doesn't even allow you to see you has liked you without you liking them without buying the most expensive version, which is frustrating."
tinder,ie,8.10.0,1,I would to be able to select that I am looking for someone tall and to be able to select nationality. As this will save time swiping.
tinder,ie,8.10.0,2,Reset the app to one of the older versions that worked fine because these new updates are making it difficult to do anything on the app üëé

tinder,ie,8.7.0,4,Great for making enemies.
tinder,ie,8.4.1,1,Keeps freezing my phone
tinder,ie,8.4.1,2,When using it it freezes the iPhone 7 and causes other apps to hang and be unusable not exactly ideal.
tinder,ie,8.4.1,2,"It‚Äôs great until you run out of likes. Then Tinder want you to pay an unreasonable fee for unlimited likes. Anyone willing to pay ‚Ç¨99 a year or ‚Ç¨75 every 6 months is out of their minds. ‚Ç¨21 for the monthly plan is not any better value either. Tinder plus is overpriced by standards of any dating app. A dating app should never cost more than ‚Ç¨10 per month. And when I say ‚Äúper month‚Äù, I mean single payments each month and not combined into one big fee as is your yearly plan. 

The price doesn‚Äôt justify the service. Slice your fees in half."
tinder,ie,iOS 8.4.0,1,The App Is Great but there is one thing you guys could work on is your pricing like paying ‚Ç¨58 in full for six month is abit much not all people can afford to pay that I rather monthly rather than paying all in one go

tinder,ie,8.3.0,1,"Ever since I updated to iOS 11 and used this app it freezes my whole phone, stops other apps from working and stops my notifications! If I delete tinder the problem stops so obviously it‚Äôs the app that‚Äôs causing this! Please sort it out üëèüèº"
tinder,ie,8.2.0,1,"Since the latest updates for tinder on my ipad air, tinder has become glitchy, freezes my ipad and I can't open matches it just crashes"

tinder,ie,8.1.0,1,"Since your recent software update Tinder causes my iPhone 7 Plus running the latest version of iOS 11.0.3 to freeze and hang.

I reported this to your feedback link and the response was basically to reinstall it and the problem was pushed back to me. It‚Äôs clearly a problem with the app.

Considering this is often a subscription services, and quite an expensive one, I am surprised at the lack of customer care."
tinder,ie,8.1.0,1,"Use to love it now hate it limited likes and they constantly try and get you to buy stuff, STAY AWAY TERRIBLE"

tinder,ie,8.0.1,1,And then there are the b*tches.
tinder,ie,8.0.0,1,I was about to unmatch a guy yesterday as heard nothing back from him. Today he messaged me as to why I hadn't replied. Useless app if the basics of messages not sending.
tinder,ie,8.0.0,1,"Really annoying problem with the app, don't seem to get any matches. Needs to be fixed soon..."
tinder,ie,8.0.0,3,I would use the app a lot more if more filtering could be applied in order to fine tune matches such as center of interests and so on. Also please can AI be used in some way to remove really low quality pictures and poorly framed one or low in light ? Thanks
tinder,ie,8.0.0,4,Enjoyable as are the chats but needs a re-fit superlikes are far to easily giving out by mistake! But that said worthwhile app
tinder,ie,8.0.0,5,I am a big fan of this app it is probably one if my most used apps to be very honest. Many of my friends are from tindr way more than from Grindr or bumble so its defanately my favourite app I think
tinder,ie,8.0.0,1,They have changed their settings.  Once you create an account it is not possible to delete it.  Don't sign up.
tinder,ie,7.8.1,1,Didn't want to link my Facebook acc to tinder and was using the app via phone number until it froze and I had to delete app. Now I can't get back onto it using my phone number.
tinder,ie,7.8.1,1,"All my matches disappeared, I received the notification of messages but I can't see them. It's like I have zero matches. Terrible update..."
tinder,ie,7.8.1,2,"Why did the last update get rid off the delete button , it seems to be getting worse instead of better"
tinder,ie,7.8.1,1,"Shocking app, no notifications, messages not coming through, not registering likes or dislikes for that matter and limited likes - what's that about? Useless!!"
tinder,ie,7.8.1,1,"So even though I have notifications on for everything , messages and matches etc I get no notifications. This issue has only started occurring in the last week. Really Annoying!!  Fix it please"
tinder,ie,7.8.1,1,New version isn't registering likes. Every time you close the app it logs out & when you log back in it's the same people again. When matches appear they don't show up in the match section. Major bugs in the new version.
tinder,ie,7.8.1,4,"I've been using tinder for a quite awhile, just started using it again and am really getting annoyed at how fast you run out of likes üôÑ also need moments back it was a great way of starting conversationsüëçüèª other than that great app üôÇ"

tinder,ie,6.8.1,1,It used to be free to use tinder but they are just trying to charge for everything. Also the app is a buggy.
tinder,ie,6.9.1,5,"Let's try 
Didn't work"
tinder,ie,6.9.1,1,Sort out the app can't log in all day !!
tinder,ie,6.9.1,5,Good app
tinder,ie,6.9.0,4,"I like the fact that only the people you match with can message you, other sites anyone can send you a message. But lately I've matched with gays that I didn't swipe right to ?????? But luckily there was no messages sent to me. Great app for meeting and chatting with new people, you find some odd men but that's just life at least you can block them üòÄüòä"
tinder,ie,6.9.0,5,Love this app
tinder,ie,6.9.0,4,I'm only writing this review so the app stops asking me too.
tinder,ie,6.8.1,5,Good when it works
tinder,ie,6.8.1,5,Good app. Meeting more woman ;)
tinder,ie,6.8.1,5,Absolute breakthrough in dating technology. Having all the ladies at the tip of my finger and with a simple swipe right they're at the top of something else. Amazing. To be honest I can't find my mates and I'm in a club so I have to make it look like I'm texting someone. Sesh is life. But honestly it's a great app!
tinder,ie,6.8.1,5,It's handy to get a date
tinder,ie,6.8.0,1,"It's become so slow , also deletes my matches randomly and when I open the message it shows blank .. Have to delete in and install it so many times , it's slow also .. Ugh :("
tinder,ie,6.8.0,2,"Deleted all my matches. Tells me I've a message but never loads that message. Constantly crashing. Have had to delete and install it so many time, I've lost count."
tinder,ie,6.8.0,1,Just went on to the app for the first time in a few hours and it had deleted all my matches and conversations..... ??????
tinder,ie,6.8.0,1,"Since the app updated, I have LOST ALL MATCHES. It keeps showing me the same person over and over again but when I click into it, it's a different person. Please sort out the app. It's beyond frustrating. I just hope it's a technical error and I haven't lost all the matches. Absolutely rubbish!!!!! üò°"
tinder,ie,6.8.0,5,Been loading my matches for ages. So annoying!!!
tinder,ie,6.8.0,4,It's aight. You're looking for a hook up ain't you?
tinder,ie,6.8.0,3,Be a lot better get more likes faster instead paying for it!!üëçüèª
tinder,ie,6.8.0,2,Bah
tinder,ie,6.8.0,1,"Full of bugs. When I'm swiping it's saying there's people but when I click into a profile,they vanish and it says there's no one available."
tinder,ie,6.8.0,1,"So I bought the annual subscription to get more super likes per day. I had 10 'super likes' per day.m and I was very happy with this. Without any notice, paying customers have had their 'super like' service reduced to 5 per day. This is the same as a mobile operator halving your data allowance overnight without any notice - this wouldn't happen. Unfortunately I won't get half of my money back and I am tied into the subscription for another 10 months paying the same rate for half the service. This is changing the goal posts from a the agreed deal and Ian now worried to think of what other features will be reduced without my knowledge. Customers are not stupid and we notice these changes. This is poor form Tinder and I won't be renewing my annual subscription again."
tinder,ie,6.8.0,1,"Crashes, bugs and log-outs are commonplace. Non-responsive customer support. Perhaps would be stronger if emancipated from Facebook."
tinder,ie,6.7.0,1,"Becoming more money orientated every day !

This app has more updates than sky news but yet when I check to see what's new it says the same each time ?"
tinder,ie,6.7.0,1,I'm only writing this review so hopefully the option would stop popping up on front of asking to review tinder
tinder,ie,6.7.0,5,Tinder would be a lot better if I didnt have to pay for more likes and the go back button...
tinder,ie,6.7.0,1,They thought I was a mug
tinder,ie,6.7.0,5,Fab
tinder,ie,6.7.0,1,"Why I lost my tinder withold name and I got instead Facebook name ,how can I bring back my name why they used my face book name ,any body can help"

tinder,ke,4.7.0,1,"Before the 4.7.0 upgrade Tinder was the perfect dating app. Unique. Meet new people, swipe all over the world and get to share your favorite moments with your matches. The latter helped not only set it apart from other dating apps but also to break the ice and to recreate talking points with matches. Now Tinder has gone from fab to drab. It's like all other dating apps. Suddenly theres nothing to discuss with matches. No reason to keep checking my tinder. This is the beginning of the end for Tinder. Bring back the moments or allow tinder to rest in peace. Very disappointed subscriber!!"
tinder,ke,4.6.1,4,Good Job.
tinder,ke,4.5.0,5,I can now cast my net in a wider pond! Love it!
tinder,ke,4.4.6,3,Average
tinder,ke,4.4.4,5,Have found many matches some just weird and not too sure on proof of age think it's important.
tinder,ke,4.4.1,1,"The latest update keeps freezing into black oblivion on IOS 8.3.
It keeps asking me to log into Facebook as well. Very frustrating 
Great app though"
tinder,ke,4.4.1,1,"Worst version ever... Keeps ""working"" but it's actually not working on iOS 8... Solution needed ASAP!"
tinder,ke,4.4.1,5,GoodJob
tinder,ke,4.0.9,5,Awesome
tinder,ke,4.0.9,5,Great
tinder,za,12.2.0,1,"Hi. A notification will come through saying people sent me a message, when I go onto the app there are no messages. When I log onto the online portal they all there. I think the app for iPhone had a issue."
tinder,za,12.2.0,2,Hi I like the app however for absolutely no reason I was just banned. This happened after I was told to verify that I‚Äôm human. I clicked the correct image and about 5 minutes later I couldn‚Äôt access my account and it says I‚Äôve been banned. Also the fact that there is no email address I can contact to appeal this is quite annoying.
tinder,za,12.1.0,1,"Look, as far as a dating service goes, the fact that I have to use an app to meet people more than suggests I‚Äôm not qualified to comment. As an app, bugs for days: frequently crashes, slows, things don‚Äôt always respond (and it‚Äôs not my phone [brand new iPhone XR]) so yeah man fix it."
tinder,za,12.1.0,5,"This App is wild ! There are literally zero serious people, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend wasting your time here. 
Others would even go to an extent of not commenting on the overratedness of this app."
tinder,za,12.1.0,2,"O Tinder congela demais, devia melhorar isso."
tinder,za,12.1.0,1,This app is hectic I was using it all along and a verification of checking if I‚Äôm human just popped and nothing is helping to remove it even after I deleted the app and installed again
tinder,za,12.1.0,1,I have been banned for violating their guidelines. Because apparently I‚Äôm underage but I sent me ID which clearly states I‚Äôm over 18. I have reported it twice and I get automatic response saying if I violated guidelines they take it seriously. But I didn‚Äôt violate them. And now I cannot make a Jew account with my email or phone number.
tinder,za,12.1.0,1,You‚Äôre soulmate is out in the real world. Trust God and you‚Äôll find them. This app isn‚Äôt the real world.
tinder,za,12.1.0,1,"There is a setting which allows women to not receive a message from someone unless they have messaged that person first. This is pretty sexist if you think about it. To think I have been paying to use this app for so long, and there‚Äôs no guarantee my messages are going through. It‚Äôs a rip off. Stick to the free version. It was also better when you could see when last someone was online. That way, if someone has been online and hasn‚Äôt bothered to reply, you can save yourself some time, unmatch and move on, instead of never knowing if they just haven‚Äôt seen the message yet. There are also just too many fake profiles now. App is a big waste of time"
tinder,za,12.1.0,5,"A brilliant site, well crafted and developed."
tinder,za,11.31.0,1,Bought a Tinder Plus subscription on 31 January and upgraded to an annual Tinder Platinum  subscription a few hours later. I am still waiting on the refund for the Tinder Plus subscription that I was informed via a banner message on the upgrade screen would happen immediately. What this is looking like is a scam by Tinder to withhold my original subscription so that Tinder can subtract a larger pro-rated amount. Unacceptable!!!
tinder,za,11.31.0,3,"For some reason, I cannot paste (or copy) anything from my chats."
tinder,za,11.31.0,2,The app has recently been glitching like crazy... I can barely type a message with a glitch. Please fix this!
tinder,za,11.31.0,2,"Please send an update, damn app keeps jamming like a rusted gear."
tinder,za,11.31.0,4,Love the app but some people only like one specific race of people. Not to be racist or anything. If you could put a mode on where you can choose the ethnicity of your choice it would certainly save a lot of time.
tinder,za,11.31.0,5,Pity you guys cannot respond to emails
tinder,za,11.31.0,1,"My profile got banned for no reason. Or at least the reason wasn‚Äôt told to me. 
A man asked me for nudes and then my account got banned. Wow. Misogyny is soooo apparent with this app. 
Don‚Äôt even waste your time. They don‚Äôt even have any way of contacting them."
tinder,za,11.31.0,1,"The app is heavily over priced. 1 year of Apple Music costs less that 3 months on Tinder Premium (gold is useless). Often have to restart the app to get profile pictures to load. Now that Im on the free version it ignores the age range and global setting. Get the complete wrong age range and people 12,000km away. Disappointing at best."
tinder,za,11.31.0,1,"Tinder banned my account immediately after subscribing to their 1 year Gold. They don‚Äôt want to give me a reason for banning my account they refer me to their community rules which I understand and did not violate any rules, I checked their twitter everyone is complaining about the same thing.  
Don‚Äôt even try downloading this app you will regret."
tinder,za,11.31.0,1,"I was singing up and didn‚Äôt put my correct birth year in and now I can‚Äôt access the app or create an account at all, how can I rectify this"
tinder,za,11.31.0,1,"I could sit here all day noting out some of the bugs and glitches but I don‚Äôt have the option to exit a profile and go back to the chat. Instead I have to close the whole app and start over.
Really weird since I had the option on iOS on an iPhone XS but got nothing but faulty left swipes and missing chat options on 11. Fix this."
tinder,za,11.31.0,1,I am of legal age to be on the app get even when I submit my ID I get blocked. How is that fair service?
tinder,za,11.31.0,1,"This app has deleted my account for the second time now, all messages and matches are gone, right after downloading the app after using the browser version, when I try to log in, all my information is gone"
tinder,za,11.31.0,1,"Just like the title says, you can‚Äôt do anything without paying, nothing at all the app is pretty pointless unless you got money for it every month"
tinder,za,11.31.0,5,I love the woman they are good
tinder,za,11.31.0,1,"Ive got 76 like that i cant view, i havent matched with anyone, how is that possible with 76 people who have liked my profile. Ive had Tinder before and this is the first time this is happening."
tinder,za,11.30.0,1,"Started using the app at the beginning of 2020, recently installed it again to give it another go and turns out I was banned... for no reason?!"
tinder,za,11.30.0,1,"Its really frustrating to have the app and not be able to use it as I cannot get into tinder. It always says ‚Äúthere was a connectivity issue‚Äù even when I have a lot of WiFi. How is that possible?. If there was a zero star, I would def give a zero"
tinder,za,11.30.0,2,"This app only had catfishes, a horrible experience for R200 for a month .. The majority of them i would google before going into a chat with because on the second day of using the app I got catfished  .. i did report all the profiles.

I would prefer when using the app you have to verify you are a legit before getting to sign up .. absolutely bs when you sign up and you just get played by some person."
tinder,za,11.30.0,1,i accidentally put in the wrong year and now i cannot try again even when i reinstall the app.
tinder,za,11.30.0,3,Great app but it‚Äôs so expensive to access everything
tinder,za,11.30.0,4,Amazing way to improve on your social skills and build genuine connections in the process. A Win-Win.
tinder,za,11.30.0,1,Rather not charge us to see who liked your profile but charge to send a text to that person
tinder,za,11.30.0,1,I am receiving notifications and nothing is changing on the app. I paid for tinder gold but my tinder is not even working. I try to ‚Äútroubleshoot‚Äù. There is no option for my issue. There is no way to come in to contact with someone to help with my issue. I wasted my money.
tinder,za,11.30.0,1,"There needs to be more live interaction 
Most the girls I‚Äôve met look nothing like their pictures in reality"
tinder,za,11.29.0,1,"Put in the wrong birth date, 2008 instead of 1998, now my account is banned for another 2000+ days. No way to get around this, their support team is garbage, terrible app, don‚Äôt download!"
tinder,za,11.29.0,1,"Use the app, sure. But do NOT spend money on it. You get banned for no reason and they will continue charging your card. Use Hinge instead."
tinder,za,11.29.0,1,"I paid the full price for GOLD! Which was R329.98 & I upgraded to PLATINUM and it said for an extra R120, instead of charging the extra seeing that I already paid for gold, it charged me full price of R409.98! I should have only paid the extra and more the full price or at least been reimbursed for the gold subscription since I UPGRADED!!!"
tinder,za,11.29.0,1,"This app is literally useless for me. Not a single person of my type, just shows me one race."
tinder,za,11.29.0,2,I can't copy paste my messages. As a good looking guy I don't wanna type the same message over and over again. Please involve a race option. I'm tired of black girls who are only interested in white guys. Please fix this
tinder,za,11.29.0,1,"Males are not able to view the likes unless they pay, but Females are able to view for free"
tinder,za,11.29.0,1,the Location that‚Äôs not true of the people
tinder,za,11.29.0,1,This has to be the worst app u can‚Äôt even see you who like without paying a ridiculous amount of money for tinder gold üò§
tinder,za,11.29.0,1,My account has been banned and I don‚Äôt know why I just l downloaded it
tinder,za,11.29.0,2,"My global feature isn‚Äôt working.
The app was working perfectly fine until today ."
tinder,za,11.29.0,1,I‚Äôve had a tinder account since 2014 and have never had an issue. Suddenly I‚Äôm told that I‚Äôve violated the t&c‚Äôs without any recourse.
tinder,za,11.29.0,1,"Joined as a couple! Was clear that we were a couple. Only swiped left for accounts we thought were compatible with us! Did not message or try to contact people after swiping. As we are a couple and wanted people to contact us if they felt okay. 

Got banned after paying for a subscription! Wtf?"
tinder,za,11.29.0,1,Too many fake profiles on the app. You have to be very switched on not to get scammed. It‚Äôs very bad.
tinder,za,11.29.0,1,"I‚Äôve not been able to use my tinder gold after subscription 
Now you guys are asking me to verify by fixing puzzle 
And I‚Äôve been doing them correct but it fail to sign me in 
What kind of app is this"
tinder,za,11.29.0,5,"Whilst Tinder is connecting ladies and gents, it‚Äôs sad that ladies of colour seem not to be interested in Black SA born guys. Is there a reason why? Or something we need to do to be acceptable?"
tinder,za,11.29.0,1,"It‚Äôs been great, just with the new update I can‚Äôt see any of the recent conversations I‚Äôve had... it‚Äôs only the first message that has been shown so have no idea what the person is replying. Please fix this."
tinder,za,11.28.0,1,"What an absolute waste of money! I‚Äôve upgraded, cleared my cache and reinstalled the app but still can‚Äôt see the whole chat conversation?! What a scam!!!"
tinder,za,11.28.0,1,I can‚Äôt see my reply‚Äôs or it‚Äôs just my phone
tinder,za,11.28.0,1,"I cannot see what other people are saying to me, and that‚Äôs just the beginning of the issues I‚Äôm having!!!!!"
tinder,za,11.28.0,1,"I am unable to see the conversations I am having with my matches. 
The messages come in, BUT I CANNOT SEE THEM WHEN I GO INTO THE CONVERSATION! 
Fix this please."
tinder,za,11.28.0,1,"Matched with multiple people, every time I just get unmatched. Waste of time!"
tinder,za,11.28.0,1,I paid for this app and I can‚Äôt read messages from people. They can read mine but I can‚Äôt theirs. I‚Äôve reinstalled the app a number of times and still not fixed.
tinder,za,11.28.0,1,"I joined Tinder Gold and started to pay... All of a sudden my account got banned. I have never used foul language nor have I posted anything of nude, nothing whatsoever... 
I followed all the rules and regulations in an appropriate manner.
Suddenly my account is banned, without an explanation!
I cannot trust this app.!!!!!"
tinder,za,11.28.0,2,"Can‚Äôt see my conversation with the people I matched with 
I get notifications that I have a message 
I see the first sentence but when I go in it‚Äôs blank ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
tinder,za,11.28.0,1,I can‚Äôt see messages when I open the texts .
tinder,za,11.28.0,3,Can tinder guys nit evaluate the identity and integrity of persons? I have so so many scams that i am not enjoying or trusting this app at all.
tinder,za,11.28.0,4,I upgraded to gold and still can‚Äôt see my conversation with people i match with. I can see when i got a message but when i open the chat it‚Äôs blank. Scam of an app that does not work
tinder,za,11.28.0,1,"I updated the app recently and now I can only see message previews. When I enter a chat, I can‚Äôt see any of the messages I have received or the ones I send. Not sure what the problem is, I deleted and reloaded the app, still have the same problem. Please fix it."
tinder,za,11.28.0,1,"When in app my chats don‚Äôt appear at all but when using a browser everything is fine. I‚Äôve deleted and reinstalled the app, even logged out and back in again, but it still doesn‚Äôt show any of my chats."
tinder,za,11.28.0,1,Not sure what the issue is but my account has been banned and I find it unfair that it has been.
tinder,za,11.28.0,1,"Literally have to reinstall the app every time in order to get new messages and every time I send messages it says not delivered and when I resend it, delete the app, and reinstall it has them sent the message twice... and repeat"
tinder,za,11.27.0,1,I saw i had 41 likes and i saw the promotion so why not just to find out that 30 of them are guys why the #### what a waste please contact me back on this i for a refund thx
tinder,za,11.27.0,5,The addition of face calling is a winner!
tinder,za,11.27.0,1,I have now repeatedly been cheated by buying a gold subscription and not receiving a boost... But there's nothing you can do and no way of getting your money back.
tinder,za,11.27.0,1,It would be great if we could have a race preference option. And don‚Äôt come with that whole ‚Äúlove knows no colour‚Äù bull..... I‚Äôm tired of seeing a certain race on here 24/7
tinder,za,11.27.0,1,"Extremely buggy, crashes constantly and uses manipulative tactics and fake notifications to get you to spend time on the app"
tinder,za,11.27.0,1,"I have a big problem why when you swipe right and like the person after a while it disappeared for no reason and the other person can still text you. Is this another glitch or bugs plus I can we have the button to retrieve other recent unmatched people back. There go to be a setting for that. Sadly I will give it a rating one star for too many problems. Like another one why no more 1000 words or more for the bio thing.

Owner of tinder you ruined tinder fix that problem."
tinder,za,11.27.0,1,Do not spend money on this app. I paid to be a premium member and within 30days I was banned. When I asked why I received no feedback only that there are no appeals. If I have done anything wrong I believe I have the right to know what it was.
tinder,za,11.27.0,1,You should start introducing a ‚Äúblock‚Äù option. It‚Äôs getting a little crazy out here.
tinder,za,11.27.0,1,I‚Äôm a single female.  I was banned from Tinder with no reason given.  Someone must have reported me. I haven‚Äôt done anything wrong. Tinder need to protect the real innocent people. There is lot‚Äôs of perverts on the group. That can blatantly advertise their intentions.  They need to revise their policies.
tinder,za,11.26.1,1,"I literally got banned for sending a person my cell number , seriously?"
tinder,za,11.26.1,1,"What‚Äôs the point of downloading a dating app if you can‚Äôt see who likes you? The only way you can see who likes you unless you have the gold version, is if you like them back and they happened to have liked you too. Just another developer who‚Äôs gotten greedy over cash."
tinder,za,11.26.1,1,"I need my money back, this tinder thing is useless mxm plz plz"
tinder,za,11.26.0,3,I want to send a message without paying and maybe actually be able to send a message to them even if we don‚Äôt match
tinder,za,11.25.0,1,More free super likes
tinder,za,11.25.0,1,"You guys literally banned my account for having too many likes because I know I didn‚Äôt break their terms. absolutely no reason at allüòÇ it‚Äôs such a joke, guys or girls, do not use this app it‚Äôs typical judgement and no privacy. NO THANK YOU"
tinder,za,11.24.1,1,Tinder was really good in the beginning but now there are so many fake profiles it makes it unpleasant for us genuine users.
tinder,za,11.24.1,1,"Your client service is useless, I had to delete my account and create a new one losing almost a 100 matches and create a new one in the attempt to connect my instagram and even now it still doesn‚Äôt work."
tinder,za,11.24.1,1,I can‚Äôt read my messages so I need to delete this app each time and reinstall it for me to actually read my messages
tinder,za,11.24.1,1,Banned without being given reasons and no where to find out
tinder,za,11.24.1,1,This app is not letting me delete my account and I can‚Äôt swipe on anyone.
tinder,za,11.24.0,1,"Where are mutual friends? Why can‚Äôt I filter more...education, height, race, religion?"
tinder,za,11.24.0,1,"After using this app for awhile, I tried Tinder Gold. Out of the blue one day my account was banned. I didn‚Äôt use foul language, I didn‚Äôt post nude pics, i followed all the rules, yet they banned my account for no reason. I emailed support and they didn‚Äôt even bother to reply to my email. Don‚Äôt waste your money or time with this app...."
tinder,za,11.24.0,1,Needs to bring back to option to unmatch with someone !!!
tinder,za,11.24.0,1,"This app is really useless

You pay for gold subscription and they are quick to take the money from your account but when you need support there‚Äôs no none

Can someone please explain to me why I am unable to delete my account

This is getting frustratingüò†"
tinder,za,11.24.0,2,"I selected not to get notifications, because I‚Äôll check up on the app on my own time.

Now though, a banner displays on every chat insisting i turn on notifications. If i close it, it pops up again after i have sent a message.

This is immensely annoying, as it takes up screen space where I‚Äôd rather see some more of the conversation.

I‚Äôve already opted out of notifications, you don't constantly have to question my decision, Tinder, stop being a nag, your ruining the experience."
tinder,za,11.23.0,3,"Tinder doesn‚Äôt keep record of the people you‚Äôve swiped left for. 
So you could easy swipe right on some and waste you the number of likes you get.
Tinder needs to improve this feature"
tinder,za,11.23.0,2,"Tinder heavily punishes you unless you pay. Paying for tinder gold won‚Äôt help you much either. There are now multiple types of ‚Äúboosts‚Äù as well that are not included with tinder gold, and if you don‚Äôt use these your profile gets buried essentially. If you move locations your profile is buried even further. (Apparently tinder doesn‚Äôt like you using the functionality you pay for). Meaning that without boosts you have to wait weeks before your profile is even seen. It‚Äôs become  a massive waste of money...rather use another dating service if you don‚Äôt want to pay an arm and a leg."
tinder,za,11.23.0,1,"you get bullied and threatened by some user of getting your account blocked and without any notice nor verification you are blocked by the developer and the person responsible is left wandering about bullying others and getting other accounts blocked,that‚Äôs very uncomfortable and humiliating and I dislike this App and will never be part of it....good riddance..i was threaten and promised to be blocked and I was unjustly blocked"
tinder,za,11.23.0,1,"First time using the app. Made a profile. Says my profile is banned. Doesn‚Äôt tell me why... so I don‚Äôt know what I did wrong & therefore cannot resolve the situation. Tinder also hasn‚Äôt have customer service contact information, so fixing problems is impossible. Use other apps because they‚Äôre 100% more user friendly and actually care about resolving users problems."
tinder,za,11.23.0,1,This app is so laggy on the iphone 6
tinder,za,11.23.0,1,"i‚Äôm getting incredibly angry and annoyed about the fact that you‚Äôve banned my account with absolutely no reason. Whoever ‚ÄúCarol‚Äù is, i did not violate your terms or community guidelines. Tinder doesn‚Äôt even recognize that there are literally accounts with nudes up. So please, y‚Äôall need to unban my damn account. And your customer support is the worst. They‚Äôve just been ignoring me. And i‚Äôve tried countless times to get my account unbanned but you guys have truly been disappointing."
tinder,za,11.23.0,3,Quite a few conmen on here
tinder,za,11.23.0,1,This app is filled with scammers.
tinder,za,11.23.0,2,"If you get super liked, but ran out of likes. You cannot match with that person and their profile disappears. So if you‚Äôre intention is for people to connect, then why cant i like someone back when they have super liked me?"
tinder,za,11.22.0,1,"I have always recommended this app to many of my friends, and it had always worked great for me. I recently got blocked, and when I enquired the reason nobody had any specifics. The 3 times I tried to get answers I would be directed to the terms and conditions and that they couldn‚Äôt go into specifics at that time. Quite hurtful and disrespectful I must say as a patron of this app for many years."
tinder,za,11.22.0,1,"I downloaded tinder for a month , then I upgraded to a tinder gold of which I payed R1200 in South African rands, after two weeks my account was banned without any notification or warning. All my money is gone ! I cnt even login anymore !!!"
tinder,za,11.22.0,3,"Dear developers. 

While using the app, after a few minutes...app crashes and returns to original phone app home. 
As well launching the app from start. Loads and crashes.
 
Please review some people‚Äôs accounts as they are catfishes and escorts too. 

Kind regards 
Ni

I hope this helps"
tinder,za,11.22.0,3,App does not work on older devices. I‚Äôm using an iPhone 6+ running iOS 12.4.8 and it fails to open.
tinder,za,11.22.0,1,Utterly horrible as I am STILL unable to delete my tinder account even though I have contacted them and it‚Äôs been nearly a week. My account looked COMPLETELY different than what it was supposed to look!!!!!!!!!!!
tinder,za,11.22.0,1,It‚Äôs not showing me anyone.. checked my settings and everything is fine.. why can‚Äôt I see anyone? And now it won‚Äôt let me delete it either.. keeps saying something went wrong... yes tinder does not work
tinder,za,11.21.0,1,I have emailed them and they not getting back to me at all as I need to cancel the subscription!!
tinder,za,11.21.0,1,I‚Äôve updated your app twice these past two weeks with no relief to the bug issues have been claimed to be sorted.
tinder,za,11.21.0,5,This app is a master of all dating apps. I even met my wife kisha on a it
tinder,za,11.21.0,5,I am unable to see my app for weeks now . I have emailed and dm Tinder but no one is assisting.
tinder,za,11.21.0,1,"My tinder is broken. Can‚Äôt see anyone..just keep searching for people then says broaden my search...it‚Äôs on the highest it can go and nothing.
Contacted support and nothing either. It‚Äôs like a dead app."
tinder,za,11.20.0,5,Great app. But can you please add a voice recorder?
tinder,za,11.19.0,1,"I don‚Äôt use the passport feature because I am not interested in matching someone I cannot meet in real life.

This is why it is particularly annoying that Tinder started to show me profiles that are over 1000 kilometers from me in the UK, Spain, Brazil, etc. I have explicitly set the distance to a particular number (36 currently) please adhere to that setting."
tinder,za,11.19.0,1,"When is Tinder going to introduce some
Kind of verification process like other online dating sites have.  I have encountered nothing but scammers using fake profiles. I‚Äôm annoyed I paid for this."
tinder,za,11.19.0,3,It doesn‚Äôt load new cards or any cards for that matter. It keeps saying check your discovery settings and that there is no one near you. The discovery setting is on its max and age is between 18-45. Doesn‚Äôt make sense.
tinder,za,11.18.0,1,Every time I try to open the app it closes
tinder,za,11.18.0,5,Was just looking for someone to talk to but it ended up to be a great relationship - thank you Tinder xx
tinder,za,11.18.0,1,"I have used tinder before. Download it again with a new profile as I deleted my previous one... and NO one is on my discovary.. There is no one to swipe on. Age and distance even changed to max... and still nothing. 

Deleted and re downloaded the app as well???"
tinder,za,11.18.0,1,"My app doesn‚Äôt work smoothly, cant see new messages, my phone becomes really slow when I launch the app."
tinder,za,11.18.0,2,"I got a match last night, sent a text and it disappeared the next morning like it never happened. Same thing happened three days ago with two matches I made. What's going on?"
tinder,za,11.18.0,1,App is stuck on ‚Äòenable location‚Äô Waste of data
tinder,za,11.18.0,1,"I purchased the Tinder Gold subscription so I could see who liked. I had over 1000 likes which I had whittled down to about 150 likes of women I might decide to match with in future. Then Tinder went down and had an issue with their servers and when I logged back in, all my likes had disappeared. Basically the reason I purchased the gold subscription. I‚Äôve sent them emails, tweets etc and I have had no response whatsoever. I‚Äôm NOT happy at all. What did I pay the Gold subscription for? Where is the customer service or support? I haven‚Äôt received any feedback whatsoever. Terrible service and communication all round!"
tinder,za,11.18.0,1,"I have been using Tinder for years. The price of Tinder Gold is astronomical and not justified. You people should stop obsessing about making money and focus more on the point of the app (connecting people) How can you not realise how many fake profiles there are? I can see a fake profile before matching with someone. You are the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù so how can you not see them? I will never pay what you‚Äôre asking because even Tinder Gold still has fake profiles. 

The app really hasn‚Äôt improved much. I‚Äôm more disappointed each time I download it again"
tinder,za,11.18.0,1,Messages not going through ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
tinder,za,11.18.0,1,"App banned me just after I open my account. Doesn't say why or give me a chance to appeal.
This is real not fair or right, at least give me a warning or a chance to correct."
tinder,za,11.18.0,2,"I‚Äôve just downloaded tinder for the first time and set up my profile and I‚Äôve allowed my location to be viewed as well as distance is 100km, but it still keeps telling me ‚ÄúThere is no one around you‚Äù. I‚Äôve researched and deleted and re-downloaded the app, but still nothing."
tinder,za,11.18.0,1,"Please fix tinder. It keeps glitching and freezing and then closes, thanks.."
tinder,za,11.18.0,1,"I‚Äôm not getting messages anymore. The app jams a lot. Every time I wanna see new messages, I have to delete them download the app again. It‚Äôs annoying"
tinder,za,11.18.0,1,Stop suggesting men when I set the opposite gender.
tinder,za,11.18.0,1,"I typed the wrong age and as I was trying to rectify my mistake the app kicked me out and banned me forever, at this point I don‚Äôt even want access to the app anymore, I just want my account to be deleted as well as my pictures and details but I can‚Äôt do that myself because I‚Äôve been banned forever!"
tinder,za,11.18.0,1,It‚Äôs a nice app I have a couple matches but I‚Äôm sad that I can‚Äôt see who likes me and I can‚Äôt afford to pay for gold.
tinder,za,11.17.0,1,"Do not buy gold subscription. It will only give you matches with people from far, not within your desired proximity. Very useless!"
tinder,za,11.17.0,1,Be ware of the catfishing syndicate if you are a black male in SA. These hoes are out for blood.
tinder,za,11.17.0,5,"I logged out from my tinder and I tried to log in back but it shows my account has been banned and I did nothing wrong!!!!!
I tried to open another one with a different number it keeps showing my account has been banned while I try to register"
tinder,za,11.17.0,1,"App malfunctioning over and over again, no profiles to view regardless of discovery settings. Attempted to delete account numerous times and app just freezes. The same problem persist from desktop log in."
tinder,za,11.17.0,4,It keeps sending double texts or gif even if I press the gif once. How it repeats the same text twice is baffling
tinder,za,11.17.0,1,"I installed this app a week ago as i‚Äôve recently had my 18th birthday but it does not work whatsoever. Every single time I open the app ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no one around you. Expand your Discovery Settings to see more people‚Äù I live in a large city which i have and know of many many friends who are on the app that live within 10km of me? So it‚Äôs pretty impossible that there‚Äôs ‚Äòno one around‚Äô in 160km AREA. I‚Äôve tried to expand my settings to max i‚Äôve tried putting it to middle, minimum, I‚Äôve updated this useless app to to the newest version, I‚Äôve tried deleting it and redownloading it, I‚Äôve tried logging off and relogging, there is nothing wrong with my internet connection whatsoever and I use a VPN, so tell what the hell is wrong with this useless app? I‚Äôve been at this for a week now and haven‚Äôt got A SINGLE PERSON? HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?"
tinder,za,11.17.0,1,Too many scammers on this app.
tinder,za,11.16.0,1,Hate it
tinder,za,11.16.0,1,I signed up for tinder plus after a few years of not using the app. So disappointed and frustrated! I have had no one to swipe on since joining. I‚Äôve tried deleting and reinstalling the app- to no avail. What gives?! It feels like a scam as I was allowed to sign up and pay for additional services yet I can‚Äôt use the app and there‚Äôs no support email/contact. I also tried deleting my account and was not allowed to do so. I don‚Äôt know what to do as it feels like I‚Äôm going round in circles. Using a dating app should not be this complicated!
tinder,za,11.16.0,1,"I don‚Äôt know why but even though I set my location settings as FAR as I possibly can, it‚Äôs says there is no one. Like I apparently get likes but there is no one? I‚Äôm in the middle of the city, what is going on?"
tinder,za,11.15.0,1,So many bugs and glitches. Such a useless app.
tinder,za,11.15.0,1,"This app has banned me for seemingly no reason.
I got no explanation, no help at an appeal , just a f&‚Ç¨k you and have a nice day."
tinder,za,11.15.0,1,I got blocked but didn‚Äôt do anything to violate terms and conditions
tinder,za,11.15.0,1,Bans you but can not tell you why.
tinder,za,11.15.0,1,How is it that I am seeing people 13000km away from me
tinder,za,11.14.0,3,I got offered an option of 50% discount on the 1 month subscription and got charged the full amount. I really like this app but seriously sort out your tech please not cool!
tinder,za,11.14.0,1,"After downloading Tinder I tried to create an account and after waiting a few minutes I had been told I was banned. 
Never allowed to use Tinder again. 
Unfortunately Tinder didn‚Äôt even have the decency to email me letting me know. 
I know I‚Äôve done nothing wrong and I‚Äôve stuck to ALL of the community guidelines. 
I‚Äôve even reported accounts using Tinder who were clearly fake as they were using famous models as their photos and names. 
I have never been inappropriate towards anyone and I think it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous I‚Äôve been banned without even being let know why. 
Horrible service. 
Wouldn‚Äôt recommend this app to anyone!"
tinder,za,11.14.0,3,"I‚Äôm using an 11 Pro Max and the app lags like mad when I try to upload new photos. My Library takes forever to load. Also take forever to select photos and cropping them bugs out too.

Also freezes occasionally when I switch to my profile or messages.

It keeps asking me permission to send notifications even though I gave it access.

Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but that didn't make a difference."
tinder,za,11.14.0,4,I was on Tinder.Suddenly banned.Been on fir at least six years.I wonder if somebody perhaps hacked my profile and put something obscene on there?
tinder,za,11.14.0,2,"Tinder needs to add a couple of selection buttons.
Instead if just ‚Äúshow me‚Äù men, woman, all options.
Perhaps add a: White, Black, indian etc option.
We have preferences and waste too much time swiping 95% left."
tinder,za,11.14.0,1,"Freezes, doesn‚Äôt work shows no matches and won‚Äôt allow me to delete my account. 

Keep giving me an error message saying that if I can‚Äôt delete it their aware of the problem and to come back later. 

Later is one month later and still can‚Äôt delete it, 

Developers fix your crappy app pls or remove it from AppStore."
tinder,za,11.13.0,1,Not only can I not see anyone... despite downloading and deleting the app many times as well as changing my discovery settings... I tried it all. Now I can‚Äôt even delete my account. Who is going to help me?????
tinder,za,11.13.0,1,Tried to uninstall and reinstall 4 x and still doesn‚Äôt work after check all phone settings! Also won‚Äôt allow me now to delete my profile either! Waste of time!
tinder,za,11.13.0,3,They are well to expensive if you lowered the pricing by a lot then more people would be reluctant to upgrade to gold. In South Africa it cost 230 rand for one month which is just stupid money
tinder,za,11.13.0,1,The app keeps telling me‚Äùthere is no one around you please change discovery opinions ‚Äú I just downloaded the app and the discovery is on 150km and 18-100+ haven‚Äôt made one swipe! So the app is completely useless
tinder,za,11.13.0,1,"This is what tinder has become, girls posting their insta handle and getting followers. 

What a sad world.

Tinder will only improve if it allows better filtering. For race, weight, height, etc"
tinder,za,11.13.0,3,"I really don‚Äôt why I got that account but good luck to you all üòò..
No pimpin üòÇ"
tinder,za,11.13.0,3,"Tinder is straight forward to use, but there are some dangers. If you live in SA, please be aware that there‚Äôs a catfishing cartel doing the rounds. I found three profiles that were fake and tried to solicit inappropriate conversations. Please verify and check that you‚Äôre talking to the real person with polite questions and get out and report if they are not.
Tinder really needs to add security measures to prevent this from happening."
tinder,za,11.13.0,1,"Im 17 and i am age restricted, and it says 17+ so i don't understand."
tinder,za,11.13.0,1,I can‚Äôt see any of my new texts..... I am getting notifications but when I open it‚Äôs just blank.... U N C O O L üòë
tinder,za,11.12.0,1,"Huge issues with not being able to delete my profile, right swipes popping up again..."
tinder,za,11.12.0,1,I was randomly banned by Tinder for no apparent reason. I certainly did not violate any of the Community Guidelines or behave in a way to justify a ban. Tinder provided no explanation for the ban and there is no process available to get my account unbanned. Terrible.
tinder,za,11.12.0,1,The app is consistently crashing. Need a fix
tinder,za,11.12.0,1,"This must be the 3rd time I‚Äôve download this app over the time span of probably a year I think. This app NEVER works on my phone! 

I want to try it out so bad but it‚Äôs really annoying that it doesn‚Äôt work on my phone (iPhone 6s)"
tinder,za,11.12.0,1,"The app isn‚Äôt working and won‚Äôt let me delete my account either so I‚Äôm stuck. I‚Äôve deleted the app and redownloaded it, restarted my phone and tried to contact tech support but nothing is happening."
tinder,za,11.12.0,1,I was off tinder for a few weeks because I started dating someone. We ended things and when I got back I‚Äôm banned. This is like really bad.
tinder,za,11.12.0,1,I feel that as a person you should be able to have a choice in what you browsing for. Really think that an ethnic filter should be put in place. Some people aren‚Äôt attracted to different ethnics. Also put weight into the categories. So we can match with someone that is similar to our likes.
tinder,za,11.3.0,1,"i can't even go into Tinder anymore. it doesn't even take me to my profile before it throws me out!

i also can't add new photos or change my main photo. the only photo i have is my main photo and i can't delete or change it."
tinder,za,11.12.0,1,Can you please allow us to search for profiles üò≠ I missed on my soulmate
tinder,za,11.11.1,2,"I love this app and used it for a while but deleted it and since I‚Äôve re-added it I am not getting any matches at all, even if I swipe right for a lot of people. It also shows me the same people over and over every time I exit the app and come back. I‚Äôve tried creating a new account/ email address but nothing works. And recently now when I try delete the app to create a new account it won‚Äôt let me. Very frustrating!"
tinder,za,11.11.1,2,Ever since upgrade to newest version . It‚Äôs dead slow tried to uninstall reinstall..
tinder,za,11.11.1,1,"The concept of tinder is relevant given today‚Äôs digital world. Having said that, there need to be more parameters in place that keep those that engage using this platform safe. Just like Airbnb, reviews regarding behavior could help curb the negative/potentially dangerous situations myself and others have found themselves in. Tinder needs to decide if it is a platform to connect people, or an outlet for narcissists."
tinder,za,11.10.4,1,Weird not sure why but seems someone has reported my profile for some reason why?
tinder,za,11.10.4,2,"The app keeps on showing me the same notification over and over and over again... even after I view everything, it disappears for like 5 min and then bam! Same notification again. Don‚Äôt get my hopes up tinder üôÑ"
tinder,za,11.10.3,5,"Howdy, deleted twitter because I thought I found the one (not on tinder)üòÇ. But now I need the app back because I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll find the one (on tinder)üòÇ. Okay sorry I digress, long story short the app won‚Äôt allow me to create an account or retrieve my old account it gives me an error message. Please assist, my Prince Charming might be matching with girls, just wanna save both our time this time ASAP. Thanks xoxo"
tinder,za,11.10.3,3,"I keep trying to cancel this tinder. How do I go about it can someone advice me . I signed for a year and yet they keep taking money off my account I used the app for one month and I did not like it . So
I would like to put a total stop. Please advice how I damn cancel this subscription 

Thank you Mishi michell"
tinder,za,11.10.2,1,I have never worried about tinder ‚ÄúGold‚Äù until one day I just got bored and wanted to see people around the world and at that time tinder had a special for the one month option! So I though why not check it out it‚Äôs only 1 month and it‚Äôs half the price! Little did I know this app just takes the next month as well and not even saying anything or confirming but just takes it off my account at the normal 1 month price! Now I‚Äôm a little disappointed in the app!
tinder,za,11.9.0,1,"This app was great. Emphasis on was. Constantly freezing , not loading matches or new messages."
tinder,za,11.9.0,1,"So a few days ago I decided to upgrade tinder to the gold/premium option. Worked for a day, now it‚Äôs completely broken. App is not messaging or matching at all. I can‚Äôt match with someone even if tinder tells me that they had already liked me. Tinder just says that there is an error. Actually the first time it happened it said ‚ÄòError: Failed to match with Jezus‚Äô. I really appreciated the humour, but now jokes over and I‚Äôm still the idiot who paid a bunch of money for an app that then cut me off. I get notified that I have messages, but when I open tinder, nothing.
I‚Äôve reinstalled the app twice and no changes, rebooted my phone etc.
The free version has its issues, but at least it‚Äôs functional.
I want my money back please"
tinder,za,11.9.0,2,Every time I exit the app and renter my profile gets completely deleted and I have to create a new profile all over again
tinder,za,11.9.0,2,"Why cant there being any searching filters, or even a message option to send to a person you want to swipe right to"
tinder,za,11.9.0,1,App not working. Error on sign up: Oops try again x_x
tinder,za,11.8.0,3,It‚Äôs a great app but really frustrating when you‚Äôre supposed to get a code and you don‚Äôt get it for hours at that when you‚Äôre trying to respond to your messagesüôÑü•±
tinder,za,11.8.0,5,"First of all thank you for creating this app, like a found a an amazing woman on this app, like yoh you don‚Äôt understand... the problem is you made it too good now she doesn‚Äôt leave the app and I don‚Äôt understand. But thank you for creating this app, now I have found my self is beautiful cycle, with a beautiful woman who smells divine and she doesn‚Äôt bother me at all. We even talking road trip in a couple of months so thank you tinder, thank you for much for this person."
tinder,za,11.8.0,1,"Tinder is a good app, I had the opportunity of using both a paid for version namely the gold version and the free version. My frustration is that after I canceled my subscription. I still get charged for the app. Now that‚Äôs not the problem, the problem is the app doesn‚Äôt change to show you paid. Everything still looks and work as though it‚Äôs not paid for. I tried looking for their number no luck in order to address this issue. Since the 24 of just which was when my free version was expiring, I am not accessing the full up functionality since it‚Äôs paid for, nor can I restore the functionality of the app. Guys at Tinder supporters what must I do?"
tinder,za,11.6.1,2,"You get banned for no reason. You don‚Äôt respond to someone and they can report you for anything and Tinder will just ban you without explanation. Don‚Äôt waste your time in this app, rather go to Bumble or OkCupid."
tinder,za,11.6.1,2,"I keep deleting and reinstalling the app. I get absolutely no matches, what so ever. I‚Äôve even upgraded to the gold, and feel it‚Äôs a waste of money."
tinder,za,11.6.0,5,"I did nothing wrong - abide by the rules but I am banned - need to know reasons....I need my account back and correct me - I have done nothing wrong...
MsFancyfree is my account"
tinder,za,11.6.0,2,I used tinder for almost 2 years. I had the free version and it worked well. Except I had a picture of a weed leaf on my profile. Which I might add is totally legal in South Africa and I got banned. No warning just banned. Iv tried to write through many times to justify how it is legal in my country and therefore I would like the other person to know that I do use marijuana to avoid matching with people who don‚Äôt accept the use of marijuana. Be careful on this app. They will not warn you they will just ban you. Bumble is much better app in my opinion. I‚Äôd use bumble before tinder
tinder,za,11.6.0,1,Bad
tinder,za,11.6.0,2,"I purchased Tinder Gold a month ago and have been actively swiping. I have not had a single match or message in the entire time. Despite several emails and requests for assistance to the Help centre, all  I get from Tinder is an automated message that my query will be dealt with.  No response has been forthcoming from them. I‚Äôve heard similar complaints from 2 of my friends. I am on other sites  and get positive results , so it‚Äôs not a problem on my side. There is something wrong with the app."
tinder,za,11.6.0,1,I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt sign up! üòÖ
tinder,za,11.6.0,1,"I have contacted your customer care and everything and I get the same excuse every single time. 
Several people are complaining about your app and all the bugs. It logs you out automatically and your profile doesn‚Äôt show up on other peoples discovery. Besides from that, the same people keep re appearing, as soon as you swipe and go back into the app all the same people are there again.

I‚Äôve been told its due to them recreating their profile but that‚Äôs nonsense. Everyone cant constantly recreate their profile in a matter of minutes."
tinder,za,11.6.0,1,"The app is good but it keeps crashing unable to log back in, delays in loading matches or sending messages"
tinder,za,11.5.0,1,"I have deleted the app twice , and now I‚Äôm trying to get back, it‚Äôs refusing me excess saying there‚Äôs an error with them sending me the access code, and my accounts nowhere to be found ü§¨"
tinder,za,11.5.0,1,"I‚Äôve deleted & redownloaded the app several times but it NEVER works. On my previous account I had so many likes I became overwhelmed & deleted the app for a while, now I don‚Äôt get 1 and no one sees my likes (even fellow Gold members) or super likes. There are still serious problems with the software that need to be addressed as it‚Äôs frustrating paying & not receiving the service paid for."
tinder,za,11.4.0,3,"This site is full of scammers with false photos and bios and absolutely no verification process to join. It would be very easy for Tinder to include some form of verification to safeguard us, however there are none. There is no filter process either to say what kind of person you prefer - religion, ethnicity or even distance from you! You can say you are looking for someone within 100 kms from you yet you are still shown people 1,000s of kms away! Complete waste of time."
tinder,za,11.4.0,1,"I tried Tinder 18-24 months ago, and deleted the app afterwards. Only to reinstall it again a few days ago. Today all the people I matched with over a year to two years ago are getting ‚Äòit‚Äôs a match‚Äô notifications from me, and sending me messages, but I can‚Äôt see a single one of them or tell them this is happening. I get notifications that I have messages but see nothing, and I‚Äôm oblivious to what is going on, what is being said, who thinks I‚Äôm randomly matching with them again 2 years later, it‚Äôs a joke! And now I have a bunch of people who think I‚Äôm suddenly interested again! Come on, get your act together! You‚Äôre playing with people‚Äôs lives and emotions and this should not be happening! And I can‚Äôt unmatch or message them or anything, I look like I‚Äôm playing all sorts of games and there is nothing I can do about it. Fix your crap, Tinder developers!"
tinder,za,11.4.0,4,I have no problem with whatever the developers decide about the app but the only thing for me is... if we going to match according to our location we need to also have an option to arrange the messages accordingly to who‚Äôs closest to you!
tinder,za,11.4.0,1,My city‚Äôs pretty small so there exactly a lot of people to swipe right on. So I basically never get matches and I haven‚Äôt matched with anyone in over a month
tinder,za,11.1.1,1,There are too many bugs and the app crashes every 5 minutes
tinder,za,11.1.1,1,"So like 60% or more accounts are spam or bots, matching algorithm more broken than a car on the scrap heap, dont waste you time or energy on this crap excuse for an app."
tinder,za,11.1.1,1,"I had a joke profile 20% of the time I had this app and most of that time was years ago. 

Most of the messages I got were supportive and laughed with me. 

But Overlord Tinder thought I was infringing tights and have banned me for life. 

It‚Äôs not like I had explicit material or was being disrespectful to ANYONE! I just used joke dating images. 

Seriously childish. Not even a warning like on Facebook or others, just ‚Äúyou gone‚Äù"
tinder,za,11.1.1,2,"My app keeps saying there is none around, it‚Äôs a new account. I‚Äôve logged in and out even deleted my account."
tinder,za,11.1.1,2,"Okay so the Gold subscription lets you rewind and even change your location tonothee cities or countries and swipe there.  Which means far more swipes and potential matches. 

But;  I hand to admit,  once the Gold subscription expires.... You're back to being unable to see who liked you. 

You might get to keep the overseas location briefly after bug whats the point? 
You just get to bokeh image to show someone liked you; you have to swipe til by chance you swipe right on the person that liked you first then onvd you're matched you could chat. 

Good luck folks.

A great UI and UX  concept; strangled by in-app purchases at high prices."
tinder,za,11.1.1,1,The app keeps showing me the same people over & over again even though I‚Äôve swiped them ?
tinder,za,11.1.1,2,"I tried signing up but once I got to my birthday it wouldn't allow me to tap continue, can i be helped?"
tinder,za,11.1.1,2,"Sign up for premium and they too my money but always blocking me out, what is the use of unlimited like? You‚Äôre just a bunch of lost time."
tinder,za,11.1.0,1,Can‚Äôt even upload a photo. Says ‚Äúoops something went wrong‚Äù problem has been going on forever now.
tinder,za,11.0.1,5,"I would like to say thank you to the staff and creators of Tinder.

Ever since my wife passed away in 1967, I have not had much luck in the romantic scene.

I have now found the love of my life, (Susan was a right old hag) through your incredible ‚Äúapp‚Äù as the young ones say.
And now, we finna get ‚Äúlit‚Äù.

Again, Thank you.
Sincerely,
Harold"
tinder,za,11.0.0,1,"Your app is awash with easyhump.com trolls. 

Insist on photo verification please"
tinder,za,11.0.0,1,"This app sells big dreams and whilst it works for most of the population it really doesn‚Äôt function well enough for the minority. The app takes forever to load data, rarely ever comes up with possible matches and doesn‚Äôt allow me to start a new account even with the old one deleted. I really could go on. At least make the app favorable to its users. Including the ones that don‚Äôt get most out of it."
tinder,za,10.20.0,5,Thank you. Dankie.
tinder,za,10.20.0,5,I use tinder regularly and most days i use it to window-shop unless I find someone interesting. It boosts your confidence and gives you an idea what to look for when you head out and meet new people.
tinder,za,10.19.1,1,It says 17+ but then in the app says 18+
tinder,za,10.19.1,3,Really cool app... but it‚Äôs been days now that I‚Äôve tried to upload new pics onto my profile and it just doesn‚Äôt work?
tinder,za,10.19.0,1,I keep on getting logged out then i have to recreate a profile
tinder,za,10.19.0,1,"I find the prices a bit alarming. I really don‚Äôt understand these prices, if I don‚Äôt choose the gold premium does that mean men in the gold won‚Äôt be seeing my profile? That I also find unfair."
tinder,za,10.18.0,1,Catfish‚Äôs galore ü§ûüèº
tinder,za,10.18.0,3,How about being able to put in 'race'? This isn't a racist thing....more about cultural differences.
tinder,za,10.18.0,1,"I‚Äôve emailed tinder over 10 times over the course of over a month regarding my tinder not working... and I haven‚Äôt received a mail back, and tinder still doesn‚Äôt work. 

PLEASE CAN WE SORT THIS OUT??"
tinder,za,10.18.0,1,And I did nothing wrong. Hardly chat to anyone. Was not rude to anyone. It is a money making scheme as I had to repay and make a new account.
tinder,za,10.18.0,1,"Tinder has gone too far with the banning regulations. The worst part is that they ban you without even giving you a reason. I had a neutral profile, no nudity, nothing offensive but just got banned for no reason at all. A few of my friends have also gone through the same thing. Even if you don‚Äôt reply to a guy quickly enough, they report you and get you banned! Bumble is so much better. I hope tinder fails soon. They deserve to!"
tinder,za,10.18.0,1,Says 1 month but automatically signs you up for a subscription.
tinder,za,10.17.0,1,"Why can intelligent people working at Tinder not spot a scammer a mile off.  They are rife within the 45-60 age group... woman looking for men. It‚Äôs so obvious! The men‚Äôs pics are so obviously photoshopped and stolen off the Internet! Their names are quite exotic! They have studied internationally (but living in South Africa). They are generally engineers ( or something equally an ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù). They are  often widowed. They have amazing pics with young kids. They call you dear. Their English language (despite having studies at ‚ÄúOxford‚Äù is very poor ... both grammar, vocabulary and punctuation! They claim to be here (South Africa) on contract and looking for love!!! Thy wooooo you straight  away! But can‚Äôt have an intelligent conversation..... just ‚Äúhello dear. I love your smile. How are you today‚Äù.........  They sometimes claim to be in Cape Town on contact  but their profile says they are 15km from me! Hellooooo Tinder.... can you not see that 90% of men in this category in South Africa are scammers ........ most of the intelligent woman know this and hate the fact that tinder does nothing to identify and put a stop to his!  And some poor (stupid) women get scammed! 

Tinder needs to identify these scammers (we all can) and make this platform more genuine for those that are really interested in meeting a real man!"
tinder,za,10.17.0,1,Zero matches coz the app keeps kicking me out. I‚Äôve reinstalled several times and even tried using different numbers but the results were the same. Absolute nonsense that I have to recreate my account everyday.
tinder,za,10.17.0,1,"I‚Äôm sure in some T&C‚Äôs this will be pointed out, however I feel it‚Äôs a matter of transparency to add a note when deleting account that charges will still apply if one doesn‚Äôt unsubscribe manually via iTunes account."
tinder,za,10.17.0,2,"The app was fantastic. Then I deleted my account and reset it. Now I have a problem that there is no matches. Even went to the extend where I super liked my friend that was sitting next to me, she swiped right and still no match? How do I fix this problem? Also cannot find support option on Tinder so I assume only way to ask is by leaving a comment here? I am a gold user - surely if you pay this much should at least have access to speak to support team???"
tinder,za,10.17.0,5,"Its an easy app to use, also my girlfriend and i met on this very platform üòç"
tinder,za,10.17.0,3,"It is NOT RACIST to expect a filter for race. Same as age, distance etc. it is a choice and both parties should be given the freedom to filter accordingly. We are all unique in person and in preference. Think about it @tinder"
tinder,za,10.17.0,5,This app gets you laid
tinder,za,10.17.0,4,"Good platform to meet people , however hackers are managing to penetrate the system and to pretend to be in the same vicinity while they are miles away with intention of forcing  people to join adult sites for their gains . Misrepresentation"
tinder,za,10.17.0,3,The message part will randomly stop working and show a loop so messages won‚Äôt send for a couple days
tinder,za,10.17.0,3,"Hi there, I joined Tinder in the US as I specifically only want to meet someone in the US - preferably California. In any event I am back in South Africa and what I can say is that there are far too many FAKE profiles on Tinder. I actually got as far as receiving calls from one who had a very obvious fake accent and then when I said let‚Äôs meet he suddenly asked me for money to buy data! So there are opportunists using your platform to commit crime. Those that I have caught out have quickly disappeared from my ‚Äúmatches‚Äù. It appears in general that there are too many low caliber individuals using Tinder because they clearly have no social skills in the real world."
tinder,za,10.17.0,1,Far too many of them and reported but they show up again and again.
tinder,za,10.17.0,1,You can do little to nothing if you don‚Äôt have tinder gold.
tinder,za,10.17.0,1,"Tinder is boring , I thought it would be fun"
tinder,za,10.17.0,1,Cant specify race
tinder,za,10.17.0,2,Far too many fake / scam people on in this age group . 9/10 people aren‚Äôt who they say they are . It‚Äôs a waste of time and annoying .
tinder,za,10.17.0,4,The boys are ugly
tinder,za,10.17.0,3,Way to expensive for nothing extra.... well a little extra but not worth the price!! Im going to Zoosk!! Same price and hit rate much better!!! Tinder is just out to make money
tinder,za,10.17.0,5,"Ahhh. So this is where everybody who used to be on the paid-for dating sites has moved to! Huge fun, as long as you don‚Äôt take it seriously."
tinder,za,10.17.0,4,"It would be helpful if members included full length photos of themselves!
1 Scally"
tinder,za,10.17.0,4,"Not a bad app, however, wish they good had filtering options on premium and pictures sometimes take forever to load"
tinder,za,10.17.0,3,It‚Äôs disappointing that it doesn‚Äôt give an option to choose areas and mostly the race of the people you want connect with. You end up seeing so many people you are definitely not interested in and you give up.
tinder,za,10.17.0,1,"I am doing this but it is actually pointless. Most men in the older age group are actually reluctant to meet face to face. Tinder is a minefield of men who are either looking for a hook up or a pen pal. Oh and let‚Äôs not forget money!!!
I believe that it works for many younger people who are always happy to meet. 
And all the men who live overseas and think that it makes sense to have an ongoing relationship via text!!!
This actually feels like a waste of time!!!"
tinder,za,10.17.0,1,Tinder doesn‚Äôt take enough precautions to ensure the profiles being loaded are legit. There are way more fake profiles than legit.
tinder,za,10.17.0,5,"Tinder is a brilliant app for the 21st century where the world is literally at our fingertips. The opportunity to meet people from all over the world, to connect, to create, to dream."
tinder,za,10.17.0,3,I‚Äôm enjoying the upgrade. Now I can dedicate songs just so to express my affection more.
tinder,za,10.17.0,5,Make life such easy
tinder,za,10.17.0,1,I can‚Äôt find my match I find it hard to use
tinder,za,10.17.0,1,I set my range close to home and 90% of the time my matches are in different counties. Not cool....
tinder,za,10.17.0,5,I rate the app a solid 10/10
tinder,za,10.17.0,1,Can‚Äôt afford to pay extra to read messages or see who liked me. So not really enjoying this
tinder,za,10.17.0,2,"It is not very accurate on distance,,"
tinder,za,10.17.0,5,I love it
tinder,za,10.17.0,5,Great app 100%
tinder,za,10.17.0,1,I have met the most amazing man to find out he has another profile of himself under another name. Why would someone even do that!! I‚Äôm so disappointed
tinder,za,10.17.0,1,"I login into the app, create my profile, and then roughly 2 days later it logs me out of the profile, and when I try to log back in, it can‚Äôt find any profile information, like it‚Äôs been completely erased. So I have to create my profile again from scratch. I‚Äôve done this several times. There must be a bug. Please get this sorted out. It‚Äôs quite frustrating üò°"
tinder,za,10.17.0,1,"Far too many fake profiles
Area settings are always incorrect. 
Indicates people are a few I‚Äôm away, but when chatting, they r on other side of the world.
Distance setting is broken. I always have mine set at 80km yes they are on other side of the world
Very very dodgy site"
tinder,za,10.17.0,3,Why do I get only ugly matches?
tinder,za,10.17.0,2,"Too many catfish 
Verify accounts
Improve the caliber of people on here"
tinder,za,10.17.0,1,The faves on each match get swapped. Messages are delayed. Notifications don‚Äôt come through. Messages don‚Äôt go through
tinder,za,10.16.0,1,This app is too expensive for its ‚Äúpremium‚Äù features. Avoid downloading it because it‚Äôs pointless being on the Free Version- you cannot see who likes you and it will take you forever to match with someone even though your Like count is high. I had 99+ likes which remained fixed for some apparent reason but would match with someone on average once a week in addition to running out of profiles to swipe with. üëéüëé
tinder,za,10.16.0,2,This app is so buggy but still requires you to pay for alot of features
tinder,za,10.16.0,5,I met the love of my life on this app
tinder,za,10.16.0,1,It keeps logging me out and then I have to set up my profile all over again. Very frustrating
tinder,za,10.16.0,1,This app is useless. Have been forced to create an account 4 times now. I paid for Gold and have had zero use. Refund my money if you have any integrity
tinder,za,10.16.0,1,Im paying for my app and still get kicked out of tinder and cant log in cause the verification sms never comes through and no one at thr tinder help centre comes back to me?
tinder,za,10.16.0,1,"No matches in months, can‚Äôt even be found by people that have searched for me in the stack, all in all a complete let down of an app."
tinder,za,10.16.0,5,Amazing app but it keeps on crushing.
tinder,za,10.16.0,5,On the App Store it says 17+ meaning even if I am 17 I can still use the app but it doesn‚Äôt want to do that it says it will only let me use it in 53 days so basically once I have turned 18
tinder,za,10.16.0,2,"It‚Äôs decent app but they have gone through too many measures to try get you to pay for their services, so much so that the app becomes practically unusable for 24hrs... As if they don‚Äôt make enough money selling/collecting our data. They should definitely look at changing part of their monetization plan."
tinder,za,10.16.0,2,Every time I try to go into the app my profile magically disappears and I have to make a brand new one! EVERY TIME!!!!!!!!!!
tinder,za,10.16.0,1,"I just received automatic subscription renewal fees after deleting the app over 4 months ago. 

I was on the app for less than a month and was disappointed when I ran out of people to swipe on. 

This has been a negative experience all around"
tinder,za,10.15.1,1,The app itself keeps crashing and I think it‚Äôs starting to affect my device as well. Please fix
tinder,za,10.15.1,3,"So why do you suddenly have limited like swipes on the free version????
It‚Äôs totally ridiculous!!
I understand the reasoning behind having to pay for extras but seriously! Having limited swipes is just not on"
tinder,za,10.15.1,1,Why can‚Äôt I use the free version to text?
tinder,za,10.15.1,5,Great App
tinder,za,10.15.0,2,"Out of likes I can understand 
But out if swipes ??? If you show me $@&!¬£ profiles  why would I even be interested in the app"
tinder,za,10.13.0,1,"I have tried cancelling my subscription for over 4 months now ! There is no option to cancel and they keep billing my account, no support number or contact, ridiculous !!!! Don‚Äôt pay for this App!!"
tinder,za,10.13.0,1,Cannot upload pictures via the app have to websites. Synchronisation is slow between multiple devices. Messages appear minutes later after getting notification.
tinder,za,10.13.0,1,"The worst app ever, have to create a new account every couple of days cause it never recognizes my details when I try log in. Do no not download!!!"
tinder,za,10.13.0,1,I have people on my matched. The ones I spoke to. Somehow the app mixed their profile. Person A picture when you open the message you find it belongs to person B. All of my matches profile are mixed
tinder,za,10.13.0,2,I have a tinder gold account and not a single person is popping up to match with. How do I get tinder to fix this or contact them somehow so they can fix it.
tinder,za,10.13.0,1,Every few days I keep having to start a brand new account. I try just logging in but I‚Äôm literally setting up a new account. Goodbye app. Deleted
tinder,za,10.13.0,1,"Wow, this is really not cool!"
tinder,za,10.13.0,1,My account got banned for no reason whatsoever! I never said anything bad to anyone or sent inappropriate images or anything.
tinder,za,10.13.0,1,"I have had tinder fur a month now at least. My tinder keeps kicking me out saying ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù and I have to create my account over and over. I have deleted the app, reinstalled it multiple times. Tried to log in with Facebook and it just says ‚Äúno account found with this Facebook profile- create new account‚Äù 

The same people keep popping up in my cards even if I have liked them. No idea why it is doing this but it‚Äôs not as good as it used to be. Very disappointed."
tinder,za,10.13.0,1,After a month of premium use my profile was banned. There was absolutely no reason for this and absolutely zero feedback from developers.
tinder,za,10.12.1,1,"App is seriously not worth it, And even with tinder Gold, Errors keep coming up."
tinder,za,10.12.1,3,"Tinder is a good app, I use the free version which is very limited but usable. I get a decent amount of matches without paying a cent but on the other hand it can be very frustrating, everything is locked behind a paywall. Simple things like rewinds and seeing who likes you, I would have no problem with this if it wasn‚Äôt so expensive. Tinder Plus is R155 for one month, R680 for 6 months and R1100 for 12 months. Tinder Gold on the other hand is R230 for 1 month, R810 for 6 months and R1250 for 12 months. What makes the price difference ridiculous is the fact that Tinder Gold offers ONE feature that Tinder Plus doesn‚Äôt, it allows you to see who‚Äôs liked you. You can‚Äôt even choose to have your age and location private unless you buy Tinder Plus. There aren‚Äôt any filters, when I say no filters, I mean NO FILTERS. You can‚Äôt choose which ethnicity you prefer or anything of the sort regardless of whether you pay or not. Overall Tinder is a decent app if you‚Äôre willing to pay, if not it‚Äôs still usable but you‚Äôll get the bare minimum."
tinder,za,10.12.1,1,Cant log in for 3 days on app but can oog in on internetbrowser with same info. Please fix!
tinder,za,10.12.1,1,"Worst dating app ever, people on here advertise themselves explicitly. People aren‚Äôt what they seem on here no decent people left ü§£"
tinder,za,10.11.0,1,My matches and messages have all disappeared.
tinder,za,10.11.0,1,"Ever since the app was updated 3 days ago. None of my new matches show up where they are supposed to. Only place I can see them is via the feed. I can‚Äôt message them, I can‚Äôt open a chat, I can‚Äôt even view their profiles. Please fix your app and add a report bug feature, of at the least make it easier to find."
tinder,za,10.11.0,1,"Stop asking to enable push notifications on the chat screen and block half the chats, over n over n over...
Chats sometimes move messages to other persons name
Keyboard come up without text"
tinder,za,10.11.0,1,"Despite eventually even paying for the application, the app resets my profile every two weeks loosing all contact and profile information. 

Also only see the same ‚Äúbatch‚Äù of people every time after making a new profile once reset without ever getting a single match from these. Once I cycled through the batch, it simply serves me the exact same batch of people...

Reached out to support twice with all the details and screenshots of the problem, only thing I got back was a blanket answer from FAQ telling me to do the same steps of logging a support case as I had done to receive that feedback in the first place.

I get bad support for free services, but even when you pay they dont care about fixing their bad user experience..."
tinder,za,10.11.0,5,"Account stops working literally hours after opening. I've had to create different accounts before the previous ones just stopped working for whatever reason.
Good concept, but horrible app"
tinder,za,10.10.1,1,"Swipped so far left I ran out of people to swipe left on. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Using a paid account to move location and there was still no one to swipe on. ü§î"
tinder,za,10.10.0,1,"I paid for gold membership was not even on 10 days, had no option of viewing anyone‚Äôs profile or picture at all??? I deleted my account but need to stop payment and request a refund for 10 days of wasting my time! The app does not work"
tinder,za,10.10.0,1,Terrible app. Doesn't work at all unless you pay for Plus or Gold. Don't waste your time and data
tinder,za,10.9.1,1,This new update is trash. Deleted the app because it keeps forcing me to enable push notifications. Displayed over images and I can‚Äôt remove it. Go fly a kite. This app is pathetic. I‚Äôm out
tinder,za,10.9.1,1,"Not soo functional on iphone 7 and 10 beeeen loading and deleting it cause it freezes and needs you to sign in again and when you do, says register as a new user ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
tinder,za,10.9.1,1,"This app doesn‚Äôt let you see your match! Doesn‚Äôt let you send a text, it doesn‚Äôt let you see who liked your profile! Unless you pay... If you are reading this just know I deleted it already"
tinder,za,10.8.1,4,I want to cancel subscription and get my money back i purchased by mistake
tinder,za,10.8.0,1,"F social media, most people are invested in self-gain and/or in search of acknowledgement of flawed definitions of beauty which is based on standards set by a society in which you‚Äôre as irrelevant as the number of likes you get on your Instagram post.

To those that are in search of the experience of meeting up and forming new friendships or relationships with multifaceted individuals, ask yourself if this is really the platform to accomplish that with all the facades?"
tinder,za,10.8.0,5,"Met a A great guy , first time user. Keep on connecting love."
tinder,za,10.8.0,1,Receive notifications that there are messages but when I go into the app there are no messages
tinder,za,10.7.0,4,"I was banned from tinder with no warning or a reason, I created four accounts already and they are all banned. It‚Äôs really frustrating. üò°ü§¨"

tinder,za,10.6.0,5,Hi guys...I just wanna know how can I cancel my subscription because I don't wanna continue with R600 package when it's ending
tinder,za,10.5.0,2,Does tinder test their code before release? I've never used a version that wasn't obviously very buggy. You guys need to adjust your workflow and hire a QA team
tinder,za,10.5.0,1,"The ads you guys added, while annoying, are understandable. What‚Äôs not understandable is the music, noise, etc from them keeping going even when you swipe past them. It seriously interferes with my enjoyment and I also find myself swiping left on the next few people coz of trying to stop the noise! The worst."
tinder,za,10.5.0,1,"Mine won't log in it was working fine and now it keeps asking me to log in and go to emails and then send message to get a code and still doesn't work , please fix mine"
tinder,za,10.5.0,1,This support system for problems on the app must be stuck in the 19th century that‚Äôs how slow a response is and when you get a response it is information you know already. They need a online chat system. Taken 2 weeks of back and forward but the problem persists.
tinder,za,10.5.0,2,You need to add in a preference option so we can choose whether we want white only or black only candidates.. I‚Äôve just scrolled through +60 black women I will never be attracted to and have wasted my time and data on
tinder,za,10.5.0,1,App keeps freezing. Very user unfriendly.
tinder,za,10.4.1,1,So it's alright for women to post pictures of themselves showing off their bodies literally putting emojis over their nipples and showing off they bums but when I cover my junk to show off my pubic tattoo I get banned. We truly do live in a society
tinder,za,10.4.1,1,"So disappointing, people reappear, app is glitchy, matches don‚Äôt sync, have to keep redownlaoding the app. Sometimes it works but mostly doesn‚Äôt."
tinder,za,10.4.1,4,Can u add a section where it shows u who u liked & shows if u get rejected or something?
tinder,za,10.4.1,1,"Every time I use it , I know all my internet settings are working but every time I swipe it will say that there is a problem with the internet connection."
tinder,za,10.4.0,2,App suddenly stopped working now I can‚Äôt log in. It keeps saying something went wrong. I even deleted the app and still nothing.
tinder,za,10.4.0,1,"I paid for Tinder Gold. It worked for about an hour before my messages stopped delivering, my matches disappeared and all the liked profiles vanished. Now I can‚Äôt even log into my account and the ‚Äúhelp‚Äù section on the website is no help at all. There‚Äôs no easy way to get a refund either despite having made the purchase today. It‚Äôs possible Tinder Gold is scam. Save your money."
tinder,za,10.4.0,2,"Account freeze when logging in and no matches display and everything when just in dust ,made interesting connections but all lost üòï"
tinder,za,10.4.0,1,"I‚Äôve been using the app for some time and never had any issues...till today!

Apart from the above, great app guys! üëåüèº"
tinder,za,10.4.0,1,Why do the ads still play after swiping them away? Highly annoying! Please fix!
tinder,za,10.4.0,1,"Cards loop infinitely despite swiping left on profiles, zero matches in 2 days and get a network error whenever I like someone on top picks. Broken app."

I want my money back"

tinder,za,10.3.0,1,Getting the same profiles over and over. And no matches are coming through. I am using an iPhone 8.
tinder,za,10.3.0,1,Can‚Äôt stand it. Won‚Äôt update my location at all so no point as I can see people nearby but no one can see me in my location nearby them.
tinder,za,10.3.0,1,Highly frustrated that I have a gold account I cannot access and they not helping to restore it. Happily took my money but can‚Äôt provide the service
tinder,za,10.3.0,1,I my app doesn‚Äôt seem to be working? I have the same guys popping up on my profile for the past 2days. I don‚Äôt seem to be receiving messages as well? Is the App down for some reason. I only have the app for 5days now.
tinder,za,10.3.0,1,When subscribed to Gold option the displayed amount is R229 and when paid the price deducted is DOUBLE  R449.89 !!!!
tinder,za,10.2.1,4,Why does my Top Pics only have white b!tches ?
tinder,za,10.2.1,5,Deleted profiles continuously reappear. No matches. Network error message on Top Picks. Deleted App and re-installed. No change. Lost all matches. Will not make any purchases until rectified. Same experience on the website version.
tinder,za,10.2.1,1,Ads play sound after swiping them away
tinder,za,10.2.0,1,"The app reloads all the profiles indefinitely. Have a subscription to tinder plus but App Store cannot restore purchase and give an error msg.

tinder,za,10.2.0,1,"Been getting errors coming up on my top pics that say ‚Äúnetwork request error, please try again‚Äù. WiFi is fine, data is fine. Creating accounts on other phones doesn‚Äôt work and I have made multiple new ones to get around this and nothing. No support from Tinder. Really disappointing."
tinder,za,10.2.0,2,App never works. Same faces keep appearing and swipes don‚Äôt register. No help as yet from the peeps at tinder despite my emails.
tinder,za,10.1.1,5,"I literally met the love of my life through tinder. 
We are both pretty shy and don‚Äôt go out often, so I don‚Äôt see how we would have met otherwise. 
We have been dating for almost two years now, and I‚Äôm incredibly happy! 

I recommend tinder to all my single friends. 

It is easy to tell what someone wants from tinder, just ask your match what brings them here. They‚Äôll say something along the lines of ‚Äúlooking to make friends‚Äù, ‚Äúlooking for something serious‚Äù or ‚Äújust want to have funüòâ‚Äù. Something for everyone!"
tinder,za,10.1.1,2,"Keep getting the same profiles over and over again. 
Redownloaded the app and deleted account and restarted multiple times and still not working.
Really frustrating!"
tinder,za,10.1.1,1,This app debited me when I only paid for a 6 month subscription. The owners/developers are thieves. Even the 6 months was not worth it
tinder,za,10.1.1,1,I bought the Tinder Gold subscription almost two weeks ago now and I have been struggling with the app since before then. I have contacted you many times through your contact website but nobody can give me any information. I keep swiping through the same people over and over. No matches. I‚Äôve checked my network connection. I‚Äôve deleted and recreated my profile. Deleted and reinstalled the app etc etc but just nothing ever happened.
tinder,za,10.1.0,5,You have millions of scammers on this site. More than I have experienced on any of the other dating sites. For anyone thinking about tinder rather use the opposition like zoosk or badoo
tinder,za,10.0.2,1,"The idiot that had the idea to put sound on the ads should be fired. You want people to keep you app open and use it, not close it as quick as they can and then wait till they are somewhere far away from everyone to use it again. Think guys. Marketing 101."
tinder,za,10.0.2,1,Seriously a pathetic app. To get it to work is impossible. Just connectivity issues constantly and looping of profiles. Then you want to charge exorbitant prices to users but you can‚Äôt even get your basic free app to work? Must be out of your tree.
tinder,za,10.0.1,3,"The location setting doesn‚Äôt work properly. It shows people as local when they are actually based overseas. 

Otherwise a good app."
tinder,za,10.0.1,1,This application never logs in
tinder,za,10.0.1,1,I was banned after a couple of days for no reason whatsoever. The idiots didn‚Äôt even have the decency of telling me why. And those criminals are still charging me. Will have to take legal steps against those imbeciles. My advice: stay as far away from Tinder as possible.
tinder,za,9.9.2,1,"The app has been broken for months. Getting a ton of likes & superlikes but not a single match... I've deleted & downloaded it again, made a new account but still isn't working."
tinder,za,9.9.2,3,"The app keeps swopping the pro pics of the people with whom you‚Äôre having a conversation with.

Come guys please fix this"

Let‚Äôs not forget, now we actually have to pay to swipe? 

This is ridiculous why must I pay if it used to be free? 

You guys at tinder need to stop this Tom foolery and make the app good again."

tinder,za,9.8.0,1,The most irritating thing ever . You start chat to Mary for couple of minutes then you chat to Mary & Nosipho at the same time ... 15 minutes later Nosipho‚Äôs conversations are moved to Mary‚Äôs profile and Mary‚Äôs conversation is moved Nosipho‚Äôs profile this is extremely irritating you can‚Äôt even open a message when receiving them coz they are mismatched
tinder,za,9.8.0,1,"Doesn't work. Profile doesn't show, same profiles keep coming up. Keep getting the message ""oops something went wrong"". Uninstalled and installed a few times and still the same. Deleting this app."

tinder,za,9.7.0,1,"I think this is so stupid. I downloaded it on my phone and deleted the app straight after because there wasn‚Äôt a option to opt out of giving my phone nr.

tinder,za,9.5.0,1,"Why do we have a limit on how many likes we can have? Trying to push us into paying the subscription, which I don‚Äôt have money for. And I haven‚Äôt even swiped in a couple days and on my first like they said I‚Äôm out of likes for the next 11 hours. How does this make sense?"
tinder,za,9.5.0,1,It seems I am unable to cancel my tinder gold subscription. How do I unsubscribe to this?
tinder,za,9.5.0,1,This damn app freezes!! My phones all laggy. I thought it was my iffen phone! üëàBULLS*T. This app not only freezing but it's also freezing my apps. I tried reinstalling it thought it would work but no. C'mon man seriously üòí this app needs to be fixedü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI couldn't even use my GPS I got lost I didn't know what was wrong. I could've have guessed it was this app. #worstappeverüò¢
tinder,za,9.5.0,1,"You‚Äôre now limiting the amount of likes, trying to monetize all uses of the app. Pretty sure you‚Äôre sinking your own ship. I feel like I‚Äôm pretty picky with the app and don‚Äôt swipe right too often so I can‚Äôt imagine what those who are more frequent ‚Äúswipe righters‚Äù are going to say. This after my app crashing. You guys are unbelievable."
tinder,za,9.5.0,1,"Very annoyed with the app right now. Since updating, it demands that I verify my phone number and does not give me the option of declining to do so. This is particularly testing as it then means I cannot access the rest of the app. 

I, personally, do not want to give more personal information than is necessary to any social app and to be forced to is highly upsetting. If this is not changed soon, I will simply move on to another similar app."
tinder,za,9.4.0,5,Keeps on saying ‚Äúcannot connect to the App Store‚Äù ‚Äî really irritating!
tinder,za,9.4.0,1,"Can‚Äôt get any more likes, boosts or anything because I keep getting ‚Äúcannot connect to App Store‚Äù error popping up"
tinder,za,9.4.0,1,"After updating to the latest version of Tinder on iOS it asked me to input my phone number (I usually use Facebook authentication). I assumed this was a new 2FA security improvement, but now I'm locked out of my account. Fail."
tinder,za,9.4.0,3,All the messages keep on disappearing. Even though the app shows that I have received messages the inbox is empty.
tinder,za,9.3.0,1,"My App stopped working this morning, Don‚Äôt know what happened üòîüòîüòî Everything else works perfectly"
tinder,za,9.3.0,3,"I enjoy Tinder but I went online and I got a message saying I didn‚Äôt log out properly so I closed the app and opened it up again to the log in screen, I type my number in and verification code and it takes me right back to the log in page again, it‚Äôs been like this for 3 days, please help???"
tinder,za,9.3.0,1,How can a person join then the app just stays on  searching what a wasteüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª
tinder,za,9.3.0,1,The same people keep being shown whether or not they are liked or disliked.  Same thing happened a week ago when I tried to install the app...something is seriously broken as this was never an issue in the past üò°üò°üò°üò°
tinder,za,9.3.0,1,Each time I login it kicks me out. I have reinstalled the app at least 6 times and still nothing happens I‚Äôm paying a subscription for nothing because I cannot get into it. This is unacceptable. I sent an email to support and nobody gets back to you.
tinder,za,9.3.0,1,"App freezes. Cannot get it to work at all. Tried on WiFi and data. Cannot update my profile info. Just keeps saying oops somethings wrong we cannot update that. Then it takes for ever to search not finding anyone and is still showing my stuff in miles yet I‚Äôm in South Africa. Adjusted every setting I could, to no avail. Deleted and reinstalled the app 3 times. Logged on with Facebook. Cannot get on to Instagram either. Keeps failing. On the search thing where you supposed to swipe it keeps showing red circles around my profile picture and then after a long time saying there are no matches even after setting it to 100miles or what ever I mean really now that‚Äôs disappointing. Please sort this out would really like to use this app. I‚Äôm using an iPhone X 256gig."
tinder,za,9.3.0,1,"This is one of the only apps on my phone that is buggy and messy. 

It will freeze. Messages disappear. Errors pop up saying messages failed over and over and over when the message actually went through fine. Absolute nightmare to navigate not to mention the extreme battery drain."
tinder,za,9.3.0,1,I am trying to meet people but there is soooo many fakes out there Different photos with all of them have the exact same tragic stories I spike to a few of the then the forgot what they wrote earlier and then forgot how there profile pics is and the looking totally different I am seriously want to meet someone but then all these fakes
tinder,za,9.3.0,1,"The app will automatically log you out and when you try log in, it says something went wrong try again later. So I waited and tried for atleast 3 days and now all the people I have made friends with are gone."
tinder,za,9.3.0,2,A legit match just disappeared. But I can search her name partially at which point there‚Äôs no info for her but she can message me and I can see her message.
tinder,za,8.11.0,5,Fun
tinder,za,8.11.0,5,Best ever
tinder,za,8.11.0,5,Tinder has been one heck of an experience for me. Getting to know others over the years and a chance to connect with new peeps. Nice! üíÉüèø
tinder,za,8.11.0,1,"I recently updated the app and now it keeps saying the app is old and I need to update it yet it‚Äôs up to date in that App Store, it also keeps asking me for permission to use Facebook and when I authorise it, it still keeps asking the same thing.. nor ngi kwatile üò°"
tinder,za,8.11.0,1,We can‚Äôt afford this. We broke and lonely.
tinder,za,8.11.0,1,"Had a pop up every 30 seconds asking if I would like to review which I selected not now over 100 times... So here it is, you got your review."
tinder,za,8.11.0,2,"There are a lot of serious issues with the app. Crashing is happening more frequently (even on an iPhone 7 Plus), and I often get kicked off.
Registered with my phone number, not Facebook, and now every time I have to force close the app (because it‚Äôs not responding), I have to get an SMS code AGAIN. Can it not just be done once?
I also don‚Äôt need to be told every single time I open the app that ‚ÄúX means not interested‚Äù. I know how tinder works. Stop the notifications."
tinder,za,8.11.0,1,"I love tinder just hate that it keeps crashing, after I loaded my tinder gold which I paid a lot of money for, it keeps logging me out saying they are reviewing my profile. I mean they shouldn't have debited money in my account if they gonna log me out."
tinder,za,8.9.0,3,This app is very bad when it comes to updating it can‚Äôt update once and continue giving me the blocking msge boring
tinder,za,8.10.0,4,Very nice app. But every time I go into tinder it says I must register with Facebook and it‚Äôs getting really annoying
tinder,za,8.10.0,1,Never had problems with the app before the new update. Since updating I am unable to see any of my old matches in my Feed ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è there‚Äôs a little circle indicating a new message but im also unable to see that... so!?
tinder,za,8.10.0,3,"5 stars for the concept. But I took 1 star away for the people, petty as it may seem the app should have filtering options of what people are looking for 
Second star is because of functionality : connections all disappear and randomly come back after updating or downloading the app again. 

Would have been a 5 because I really like tinder, I connect with both ladies and gents especially for when I travel I can change my location and chat to people before my trip"
tinder,za,8.10.0,1,Irritating that the app asks you to review literally ALL the time.
tinder,za,8.10.0,5,"I like tinder for its privacy picks..no one messages you! Unless you match them and no body can bother your privacy if they annoy you (once matched) 

You just unmatch ( no annoyance, no messages,no archive) clean and fun..... always nice and pleasant"
tinder,za,8.10.0,1,The app keeps freezing
tinder,za,8.10.0,5,"It's user friendly and navigation is superb..

Kind regards"
tinder,za,8.9.0,3,My app doesn't want to log in although it was logging in before not sure what is wrong
tinder,za,8.9.0,2,"I love this app, yet after this update I can‚Äôt login! I try use my Facebook account login, and it just takes me in circles. Then even when I go phone number and create a new account, once I type in my new password and click ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù, it literally just does nothing. Ugh"
tinder,za,8.9.0,1,Useless website. You cannot even select preferences. You can only see a photo once. And I thought it was free.
tinder,za,8.9.0,5,Thank you
tinder,za,8.9.0,4,"Totally easy to use. It's fun to just swipe and swipe some more to learn something about your person of interest. 
When it's a match, the moment is somewhat celebrated because you're stopped and given a opportunity to text them. That's cute. 

However; it would be nice to be able to change my age. 

Winning!"
tinder,za,8.9.0,5,great app.
tinder,za,8.8.0,4,"Area location does not work. States 13 km away yet person is overseas or in Cape Town compared to my location, Johannesburg."

tinder,za,8.8.0,4,Pretty okay
tinder,za,8.8.0,3,Can we please have preference options other than age. Please add race as well.

tinder,za,8.7.0,5,"I've had a good experience with tinder and had 2 chats turn but dates. Don't get why there are mixed opinions out there, I like it."
tinder,za,8.6.0,5,This has helped me meet new people out of my circle . It‚Äôs really good
tinder,za,8.5.0,1,"The latest update deleted my entire profile!! No photos, about myself gone and had to reset all my settings to how it was. Deleted my account, not typing everything all over again! Even my matches were deleted"
tinder,za,8.5.0,4,"This version is much more stable, thanks guys. 
Messaging interface is still a bit archaic."
tinder,za,8.5.0,5,I haven‚Äôt had a single issue. Quite like the fact that I can see who matches with me.
tinder,za,8.4.1,1,"I‚Äôm truly not impressed with tinder. I‚Äôll Super Like a girls profile and move on to other profiles but then when I open tinder again after a few hours the same persons profile shows up and I can Super Like her again however I doubt she even knows. What is going on?!?! Come on Tinder, get it together!!!"
tinder,za,8.4.1,1,"Hi devs - make no mistake about it, I love using the tinder app however I am experiencing serious performance issues. I‚Äôm currently running an iPhone SE with the latest version of iOS 11. The tinder app slows down or crashes on occasion. And switching between apps can freeze your phone. I hope you manage to look into these issues and get them sorted."
tinder,za,8.4.1,1,I used to like tinder but since one of the latest updates every time I go in via safari via Facebook which is a pain and I‚Äôm going to delete it.
tinder,za,8.4.1,3,"Drains my battery way too quickly. Got a iPhone 5s on latest iOS 11 and latest tinder update. 
Fix this"
tinder,za,8.4.1,3,"I love the app and what it is capable of. 
But it won't open for more than 5 seconds without crashing... Very disappointing..."
tinder,za,8.4.1,1,"I haven‚Äôt seen a response to this from the company but maaany people have been complaining that the app crashes phones... I am also one of those people. 

The app makes any other app (open or opened) crash, almost takes out the whole phone itself. When browsing for long (we all do it) Tinder freezes and then crashes.. This shouldn‚Äôt be the case, with the prices being charged within the app it should be far better developed. Please fix this. Invest in UX designers and App Testers"
tinder,za,iOS 8.4.0,4,"I really love Tinder, it is a lot of fun and been using it for years! Usually excellent service but lately it has been glitching. Please, we need an update or something! It makes my phone crash."
tinder,za,8.3.1,4,"Lekker toep. Vir die maer man en die boep. Bring die w√™reld na jou stoep. 
Wat kan ek s√™? Dis als wat 'n man wil h√™. 
I think everyone would generally have a better time using it if you tried to be as honest as possible. Don't fake it till you make it you social media aficionados. Just put it all out there. Be vulnerable and be brutal. Well then. May the best man/woman/earthling win!"
tinder,za,iOS 8.4.0,1,"There is problem with tinder, cant use other apps while tinder is open. Almost crashed my whole phone when trying to do it. Tinder not good for Iphone users. They must really up there game for Iphones. Almost lost everything on my phone, be careful when downloading this app from you Iphone."
tinder,za,iOS 8.4.0,1,"Tinder what is up with the app. It shouldn‚Äôt use so much power. This app Freezes my whole phone blegh. 

Nice app but I don‚Äôt want to use it of it freezes my phone the whole time."
tinder,za,iOS 8.4.0,3,New update persistently resets max age to 55.
tinder,za,8.3.1,1,"It kills your resources on an Iphone, i Have the Iphone 7plus which has enough resources. But it still freezes my whole phone. Then i have to restart my phone. Please fix it.
It is an app with a good concept. So fix it before killing your customers."
tinder,za,8.3.0,1,"Obviously the idea of the app is a game changer but what the flying F@&$ is up with it freezing all the time?? Not only is the app freezing but it‚Äôs causing other apps to freeze or not even open? It has frozen my iPhone 6s for over a minute the one time. What if I‚Äôm dying and need to call a doctor or something? I could die and stuff. 

No seriously, please fix these bugs because as soon as you don‚Äôt quit the app properly after using it, you‚Äôll regret it for the longest minute of your life!"
tinder,za,8.2.0,1,"There is something seriously wrong with this app. I don‚Äôt care about notifications not showing or any of that. No. This app causes SERIOUS strain on your phone. 
I had it on my iPhone 6 and the app froze (also froze my iPhone) and kicked me out of the app eventually. My iPhone would sometimes even reset whilst in the app. My iPhone 6 was old and I thought it might just be the iPhone itself.

I now got an iPhone 7 Plus (256GB) - exactly the same issues are occurring. I have deleted it, because now when the app crashes, it even causes problems with my 3D vibrate. This I can only resolve through reseting my iPhone 7 Plus. It is thus clear that it wasn‚Äôt my good ol‚Äô iPhone 6, but your app. 
Plainly speaking, I love the app, but you need to fix some serious issues before this can be enjoyed how it was enjoyed a little while back. 

Fix it. I won‚Äôt be using it before you do."
tinder,za,8.2.0,1,Something is wrong with how you guys implemented your new tapping on images without entering the profile. Every time I use the app I have to kill the app because it makes my screen unresponsive otherwise. Please fix it
tinder,za,8.1.0,5,"The App is so great and very helpful. It's not like any other Apps that I tried before, it stands out and it's so unique and user friendly I just love it."
tinder,za,8.1.0,1,The app itself isn‚Äôt bad. Good in many way but what lets it down is that if tinder is open on my phone and minimize it and go to another app then my phone freezes and it only happens when tinder is open.
tinder,za,7.7.2,1,"Recently became aware of slower and laggy swiping. Not fun anymore, simpler is better but not with these updates."
tinder,za,8.0.0,5,"Very cool app, one thing I want to see is who's online? Or last time they were online."

tinder,tt,11.2.1,1,Every time I try to open the app it keeps shutting off. I tried restarting my phone and the same thing keeps happening.
tinder,tt,11.1.1,1,"As I‚Äôm paying for this app I would like some decent help with he bugs furthermore  there are several bugs on the chat system and the REPS have not given me any solution, they have just stopped replying after 3 interactions with no useful information definitely will not be renewing my subscription."
tinder,tt,10.18.0,4,Great app lol
tinder,tt,10.17.0,3,Your app keeps crashing
tinder,tt,10.3.0,2,"I agree that the new updates have not been fun. I was locked out of my account for the Better part of 3months (ruined a lot of connections might I add) and asked to ‚Äúverify my number‚Äù. I tried to several times and even sought help from their reps who only gave mundane answers and then stopped replying altogether. I even tried to connect them on Twitter but no one responded. Finally I did some clicking around and finally got through on the desktop version - thanks to MYSELF not Tinder‚Äôs support desk. Very disappointing. 
I‚Äôll end of this note- that I‚Äôve been leaving feedback w/ Tinder for a while now, informing them about, what would seem to be, bugs in their system where msgs disappear and you don‚Äôt know who you‚Äôre actually speaking to. #doBetter please"

tinder,tt,7.0.1,5,"Tinder helped out some of my friends find their lover,cool stuff."
tinder,tt,5.5.0,2,"Was fun at first but of recent the app continuously refuses to open. When I open it, it automatically closes on me in a couple of seconds.

tinder,tt,4.4.6,3,It is okay. Has a lag time in terms of msgs coming through but otherwise okay.
tinder,tt,4.3,1,"So far I haven't been able to login on the app because of an error on the SMS verification page (""Whoops! An error occurred while requesting a token for SMS verification. Please try again."") that also seems to be plaguing a lot of users - proven after searching the Internet for a solution. So, until this issue is resolved and I can actually use the app, I'll reconsider my current rating."
tinder,tt,4.0.9,3,Decent layout. Questionable results with respect to who is actually within the range you select in preferences. At times it says no one is around then it suddenly finds someone 1 kilometer from you who would have been there 2 min ago when you first started looking.

Twitter are Willing to turn a blind eye on months of leftist violence, egged on by Demoncrats Twitter chooses to shut down conservative accounts. Twitter are willing to allow violent groups recruit, run and coordinate violent attacks on cities and innocent residents. 

The coordinated attack on Parler with their Billionaire buddies shows Twitter, Google, Amazon and Apple in their true light.

twitter,au,8.52.1,3,"Uploading saved videos from my iPhone to twitter, ends in the video being unwatchable. All social media compresses video content, however twitter seems to have gone to new lows.

twitter,au,8.52.1,5,The premier social media pulse made in thoroughly smooth and accessible style.
twitter,au,8.52.1,1,"Twitter is no longer an impartial platform. It has become a tool for propaganda and suppression. I am interested in views from all sides of the political spectrum and like to share interesting posts for discussion from every side... Twitter increasingly censored everything from a certain side, coming to a peak late last year. The abusive violent speak and backlash towards me personally that would accompany any conservative retweets, - never progressive or indeed far-left that I would share, violated their standards regularly yet would never be taken down or flagged by Twitter. Yet in the end my own profile was shut down after sharing posts which spoke impartially about all factual perspectives from both sides to a hot debate late last year. This sort of blatant political censorship is Orwellian, manipulative, brainwashing and infringes on human rights. Sadly, Twitter just simply cannot be trusted anymore, it is best to find an alternative that does not have a political agenda or which seeks to influence or limit your access to information that doesn‚Äôt fit in with their personal political views."

twitter,au,8.48,5,"I love Twitter. Yeah, I know ..... but don‚Äôt follow those who are negative, insurrectionists, or those out for cheap laughs at expense of others. I‚Äôm informed on Twitter by archeologists, historians, travellers, animal lovers, scientists, film and book reviewers, serious journalists, and get to see wonderful photos, maps and sometimes bizarre images I would never see without Twitter. But do fact check and read articles before retweeting.  Twitter is like any village. Some people are true and honest, some lie, some try to attract attention by seeming to be outrageous, and a tiny minority are toxit. Avoid the tiny few - or if you see them REPORT."

Yet, nothing from Twitter. As supporters of Twitter I think we deserve an explanation."
twitter,au,8.48,1,Unfortunately Twitter has destroyed the platform by censorship filtering out to only display there own agenda. Profiles are also requiring more user data and personal information which is also unacceptable.  Bye Twitter.

This is not a platform for free speech, but rather a platform for the radical left. Jack needs to be in prison for his actions. Other than that, I like that Twitter has woken millions around the world to the worldwide DS agenda, so thank you Twatter!"

twitter,au,8.48,1,it‚Äôs a joke
twitter,au,8.48,1,"Twitter is becoming Weibo, which is a mouthpiece of a Marxist-Leninist Party."
twitter,au,8.48,1,Twitter is social networking service. It‚Äôs core user base consists of far left extremists that support terror organisations such as ANTFIA and BLM. The service appears not support users of alternative views to there own. This appears apparent by the deletion of many accounts of republicans or users who are unable to share and discuss there opinions thus eliminating free speech on the service.
twitter,au,8.48,1,Time to say good bye
twitter,au,8.48,1,I hate the censorship Twitter is imposing on people and groups. You clearly don‚Äôt want the truth on matters to be told. People are not stupid!! Twitters fate will come to a dreary end.

twitter,au,8.48,1,Shame! Shame! Shame!
twitter,au,8.48,1,Not a very good app. There is a lot of fake profiles just spilling hatred from the Alt left to the Alt right. Twitter will generally only silence one of those sides but both are as bad as the other. Not a very good platform for more balanced individuals.
twitter,au,8.48,1,"Good app, terrible censorship of opinion."
twitter,au,8.48,1,I‚Äôve been on Twitter for 10 years and I‚Äôve never seen anything like the censorship that is going on right now. I‚Äôve spent years and years reporting accounts for child pornography and nothing gets done about it but they‚Äôre happy to censor anyone that supports a different political party to jack and his crew at Twitter. I don‚Äôt understand why there is such involvement from social media in politics. Absolute disgraceful behaviour. Not worth the download.
twitter,au,8.48,1,Stop censoring mainstream political leaders.
twitter,au,8.48,1,"Garbage app that relies on the extreme views of its users. 

Used to organise and facilitate far left groups in the destruction of private business in USA, harassment of police and citizens which resulted in the deaths of many.

twitter,au,8.48,1,It is disgusting that you censor Trump and turn a blind eye to the hate from the left. If I could give zero stars I would. Find one piece of footage of Trump inciting violence and post it. You won‚Äôt because you know there is none.
twitter,au,8.48,1,Ban Twitter for censoring President Trump.
twitter,au,8.48,1,Big tech censorship!! They try to take our freedom of speech
twitter,au,8.48,1,"I used to like Twitter, mainly because of connecting with others. But now it has become a negative sesspool that censors anyone that doesn‚Äôt agree with its views.. I will be closing my accounts down.."

Awful."
twitter,au,8.48,1,Terrible app owned by CCP.
twitter,au,8.48,1,"For many years now Twitter has shown to favour one political side, this has only become more extreme with the 2020 elections. I can‚Äôt use or respect a social media platform but excludes political ideology of people that they don‚Äôt agree with. Incredibly Imperial and un-American."
twitter,au,8.48,1,Bad Censorship
twitter,au,8.48,1,"Jack and his team ban people for just being conservative but are happy to allow those who promote violence, rape and other horrible thoughts. The hypocrisy of Twitter is sad. It will be nice to see the fall of this outlet soon."
twitter,au,8.48,1,So disappointed that political agenda exists in the management and control of this app. They have never been neutral and have actively tried to influence voters. This is not a good long term strategy unless in China where no free speech is allowed.
twitter,au,8.48,1,"Suspending the account of the US President? So his 88M supporters will probably leave as well. Trump is the most talked about person in the world. He will find a voice. He will probably start his own media organisation and it will be unbelievably successful. Twitter never was representative of the ‚Äòreal‚Äô world. Politicians would use what was important on Twitter to develop policies and then fail miserably. Real people aren‚Äôt on Twitter. It‚Äôs just a safe space for confirmation bias. But, only if you‚Äôre on the left. It‚Äôs important to know what everyone is thinking. Most conservatives were moving to Parler, but of course that was shut down. If this was happening to left media organisations there would actually be street violence. This is going to fester now and the US could actually implode. There‚Äôs probably 100M Americans who feel completely disenfranchised and that‚Äôs dangerous."
twitter,au,8.48,1,Toxic app for toxic people!

twitter,au,8.48,1,"So Twitter - the new government who governs our government - has heroically stepped in and prevented people from hearing current President Trump say, ‚ÄúYou have to go home, we have to have peace.‚Äù

One can only imagine the further violence and carnage that could have happened if Twitter let people see that video. Once again big tech has stepped in and done something for us, for our protection. Thank god for Twitter.

twitter,au,8.48,1,"The Twitter bias and bigotry against honesty and truth is outrageous, especially as a supporter of Jews, Zion and Israel. They unreasonably and unfairly closed and did not reinstate my @Fab29292929 MonicaMalka account for innocuous tweets while World leaders call for death to Israel and Jews lavishly. They have done similarly to numerous Jewish and Israel advocate accounts. They sanction many of us without a fair process. So, sadly, their judgements on the USA and the World are supposedly fair but are more media bias, and bigotry. They take themselves far too seriously. They state they will act against Holocaust Denial but fail to act, and leave it to me and hence suspend my @Fab131313 MalkaMonica."

I love to say ‚Äúhi‚Äùto my followers when time permits as it is important to give back and see what they are doing ( they‚Äôre all extremely bright, creative and dedicated  ) and come from all walks of life!. It‚Äôs also an invaluable platform for people engaged in animal welfare  as well as environmental issues as people tweet in real time. This permits people to cross engage and help one another at great speed. The sharing of world news is also pertinent as it allows countries to quickly dissect all the bits that matter. And there‚Äôs quite a few bits on that front!.  Twitter has been an incredibly reliable platform for many years that I always look forward to using. I love all the new buttons and features and I look forward to using them most of the time all the time, hopefully to enhance my work. Thankyou Twitter!  A sensational platform!"

You even censor President Donald Trump. Pathetic! You blocked the Hunter Biden laptop story from being reported. You should be ashamed of yourselves.

Unfortunately Twitter also spams me with recommended tweets and ‚Äúin case you missed tweets‚Äù. These are just spam I don‚Äôt need notifications for tweets from people I follow. There is no way to turn off these utterly useless notifications so instead I have to block ALL notifications from the app rendering it useless. 

Twitter let us turn off these irrelevant notifications."

twitter,au,8.47.1,2,"I have only had Twitter for a while now but have relied Ethan Twitter can be biased on a lot of topics.
I have seen others get banned for going for Biden or even disagreeing with things that are minor. Then we have so many people EXCESSIVELY swearing. I understand swearing once but more than that and especially using slurs? Other people are posting inappropriate content, and they don‚Äôt get banned. I find it backwards, but if you get on the right side of Twitter it may be ok."

twitter,au,8.47.1,5,"I follow a lot of people and it‚Äôs hard to keep up with everything I see on my feed. On Instagram, I would have to create multiple accounts to follow people to have my feeds more organised. On Twitter in the other hand, I don‚Äôt need to do that as there are lists. Lists are feeds where you are able to add profiles onto it and all their tweets will appear in that list. It‚Äôs like creating a separate feed and choosing what you see in it. It‚Äôs the best way to organise what you see on social media and I am in love with it. I have a music feed where I chose to add artists I love in there and I can just go there anytime to see what‚Äôs going on in their world, and then I have another list for Films. It‚Äôs great and this one feature alone made me give this app 5 stars. Twitter has everything else that all other social media have, but even more features."

It‚Äôs obvious to sane people that Twitters echo chamber (there can be only one here) has literally turned sane people into emotive idiots, that feel assaulted when someone airs a different view to their own (or I should say the collective).

twitter,au,8.44.1,5,"Totally disappointing to have this not as a free platform. Disgusted at the amount of evil links allowed including porn... and the lack of true freedom of speech. The election bias and interference that is clearly sided with the democrats or alternatives. The False disinformation warnings and health warnings associated and attached to any differing facts that do not suit the alignment with the radical left. The fact that you do not allow people to choose, even if they a incorrect. The manipulation and mass control of information that should be freely available. Everyone involved should be held accountable and or fired and prosecuted. This is not a platform, it‚Äôs has become a Publisher and should be treated as such. Twitter takes advantage of people that do not have the same interests, I want diversity, and transparency. Algorithms should be implemented to protect the children, the vulnerable and should be the end to CP sharing that occurs on mass. If you can censor or limit or shadow ban the President of the United States and doctors, professionals and expert scientists from sharing their interests, finding and beliefs and the common people from being able to access these and make the own minds up, yet you manage to not apply that technology reducing or banning to criminal, abusive and other false information activity, then you have proven that you should be held accountable. I would not use this platform if I didn‚Äôt think this is hugely important to expose this to all and value true freedom to speak and freedom of speech. This is highly insulting and very disappointing and also... possible criminal. Be well, but be aware that more and more people will not stand for this manipulation - the world is changing and you have picked the wrong side. May you endeavour to changes your ways and own your to the truth, so help you all. If you have a heart, now is the time to start the long journey home and denounce all this activity. May the true force be with you, everyone has a chance to turn things around and work for the good of the people and not collude with covering for criminals, suppressing stories and opinions and allow the connection of people all over the worldwide to think and discern for themselves. You have lost your way and all this platform is supposed to represent. This is not a safe space for all to share. It is controlled and manipulation at its worst. Thank you."

Whilst I understand there must be algorithms and suspensions, Twitter has gone way too far. People from the left use this to get people off the platform. Algorithms are used to suspend accounts for saying Trump won the election. Yet no one is getting suspended for saying Biden won? In fact Twitter uses fact checkers to say Biden has when clearly there is no definitive winner yet. Also algorithms to ban accounts that have Hydroxychloroquine and cure in the same sentence. These tweets don‚Äôt need banning. They need fact-checking. The reality is even a vaccine won‚Äôt be a cure. Effective yes.. but not a cure. This shows how ridiculous the banning of these tweets are. I currently have a suspended account under review. I have never been rude or broken any Twitter rules. Unfortunately I can‚Äôt say they same for my treatment on this platform. I think I had 600 blocked. All for personal abuse. Unlike many on this platform I use my real name and location. Unfortunately that has lead me to be doxxed. The person who realised my LinkedIn details on Twitter faced no ramification. This shows the discrepancies. Hopefully this review is read and reviewed by real people and not just a computer program. Twitter is a good platform. But if decent people like myself get suspended accounts for not breaking rules many loose faith. When they loose faith they change platforms. Personally I feel this is a real challenge for Twitter going forward.

twitter,us,8.54.5,1,Twitter constantly kicks you out of DMs and the dm portion is becoming more glitchy as we go. The suspensions are getting out of hand too with very little options to unlock accounts. Get your app right before you worry about going on a suspension spree. And give better help options to get your account back if it is wrongfully suspended. Twitter has really gone downhill over the past year and is becoming less user friendly as we go.

twitter,us,8.54.5,5,"i love this app. i really do, i‚Äôve made so many good friends, this app has educated me so much. but i hate twitter cropping."
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,"Literally no one asked for this feature. If y‚Äôall are looking to go the way of Tumblr, then add it and don‚Äôt look back. I‚Äôve used this platform for over five years, but if this feature is here to stay, I may very well stop using it and not look back myself."
twitter,us,8.54.5,4,"Please, just give us an Edit button/option"
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,You used to be a forum to share all ideas but now you want to censor anyone with a conservative viewpoint! This what they do in Communist countries. ü§¨
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,^see above
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,"If by some miracle you don‚Äôt already know what Twitter is or you haven‚Äôt been swallowed by the corrupting sickness of Social Media yet. Don‚Äôt. Just close this and play a game or something.  Social Media was a mistake.

twitter,us,8.54.5,5,Wow this app is awesome you can post photos and and written stuff it‚Äôs awesome you should download this app it‚Äôs Awesome download right now it‚Äôs awesome
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,"Twitter bans of those who‚Äôs views they disagree with is why I gave it such a low rating. I enjoy many things about twitter but the fact that they allow some of the most disgusting images, statements and views while at the same time targeting conservative views will eventually lead me to an alternative.  Or hopefully a self evaluation on their part and and better more equitable process of oversight."
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,Censorship is not based on logic but emotional control.  I am unable to be a part of such bias
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,permanently suspended me despite not breaking ANY of the sites terms and conditions.
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,I like my news but hate that it‚Äôs a forum for hate
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,It was enjoyable until bias & censorship.
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,"Apparently no users exist when trying to use Twitter on my new iPhone 12 with 14.4 iOS.  My time line loads, but every time I select a user to view - I get same message - the user does not exist.  Every time.  So frustrating.  It works fine on my iPad - just not the new iPhone.  üò°"
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,"They shut down my account in their ongoing censorship of the ‚Äúright‚Äù for my stance against the abuse of women and children. I notified the FBI of the child molestation all over their platform numerous times, which became mainstream news months later. Would recommend competitor Gab, where you can speak freely and not littered with child abuse."
twitter,us,8.54.5,5,"Less data , great speed and accessibility"
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,I can‚Äôt log into the app because of some captcha reason I have to only use browser and every person page I click it says they don‚Äôt exist unless I am on the browser... what‚Äôs that about?
twitter,us,8.54.5,5,"great app , love to be on it daily , highly recommend!"

twitter,us,8.54.5,3,I enjoy this app and use it everyday but one problem I have is that you are letting people put pictures of other people without their permission and that unacceptable like suspended their account and make them remove the pictures!!!& I have already emailed you guys about it and NOTHING has happened!!!
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,Claimed TwitterSpaces beta was for underrepresented communities but that‚Äôs not who they gave access to.
twitter,us,8.54.5,5,Pushing people to follow liberal mainstream propaganda.
twitter,us,8.54.5,5,purr ate
twitter,us,8.54.5,2,Poor navigation.  Needs better flow. Obviously I must be only one that thinks that.
twitter,us,8.54.5,5,"It is a GREAT application and I recommend it to you guys,
I just have one little thing: please fix the fleet when we share the tweet with the photos it with being like sensitive content even if it doesn't have anything sensitive."
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,"Right now the Twitter community is having a HUGE issue with something called ‚Äú#megalinks‚Äù
People are going on throwaway accounts and using the hashtag to search for other sick people to trade child p*rnography! Apparently it‚Äôs been an issue for a while and Twitter will not do anything about this hashtag or the people using it.
This is vile."
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,They keep censoring more and more!!
twitter,us,8.54.5,4,i love twitter sooo much. it‚Äôs one of the best apps where i can rant about how my day is going/went. i‚Äôve never been this REAL w/ my life likeee EVER tbh hahaha.
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,Restore me and we can talk one more star. You are not the arbiter of speech

twitter,us,8.54.5,5,@marcauthor@BlueFidelity Thanks!
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,"Operators of this social media app should be in jail for the manipulation, political interference and interference with freedom of speech. Parler is a better alternative."

twitter,us,8.54.5,1,Censorship by Twitter is not American; very sad
twitter,us,8.54.5,2,"I‚Äôm very disappointed because for me Twitter was the best social media, interacting with others and stay connected and informed is great BUT I consider that is necessary to establish control measures in fake news and hate speech in this network. Also block accounts from terrorist like FARC in Colombia o spread videos from this type of terrorist groups."
twitter,us,8.54.5,3,It‚Äôs ok
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,Stop restricting content.  Let people decide what they should and should not see.
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,"If you want to be shut down for having an opinion that differs from that of twitter‚Äôs, then carry on...  If you want to get your voice out there and share truth and logic, don‚Äôt bother!"
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,Stop censoring conservatives.
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,Your censorship will be your demise
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,"Twitter can no longer be considered a place where debates take place. It only serves to make it appear that debates are taking place. 

Twitter doesn't even try to keep up the appearance of their censorship somehow serving public safety anymore. Twitter is far from impartial, their decisions reflect the extremist views of those who work on it

Disclosure: I have never been banned or even suspended from Twitter. I gave up my account of many years after seeing the real-world negative impacts this app has on people and on our discourse."
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,An app that supports communism
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,Silences conservative voices
twitter,us,8.54.5,1,"I‚Äôd give it half a star if I could. As of right now I can‚Äôt make an account. Keep in mind I‚Äôve never used Twitter before so the reasoning I‚Äôm not allowed to make an account doesn‚Äôt make sense. I have the right requirements to make an account but it still won‚Äôt let me. My phone number is valid, so is the code. But it tells me to try again later and when I do, it still won‚Äôt work. Make it make sense, explain to me why I can‚Äôt make an account. It‚Äôs infuriating."
twitter,us,8.54,1,I truly dislike this platform.  I don‚Äôt think it needs too much more elaboration.
twitter,us,8.54.5,5,No complaints.
twitter,us,8.54.5,5,"Allow my President Trump to send tweets, we have take over this demented administration before this country goes beyond repair!"
twitter,us,8.54,1,Twitter unfairly suspends users without any due process. Users have no recourse.
twitter,us,8.54.5,2,"Twitter you‚Äôre honestly weird ..,. To have notifs for when someone mentions you in a comment but it won‚Äôt show the original post that they mentioned  you in. That‚Äôs honestly my biggest pet peeve."

twitter,us,8.54,1,"Twitter constantly undermines free speech and deletes anything that is anti-China, anti-globalist, and conservative, while hypocritically leaving anything liberal, pro-CCP, pro-government, and anti constitutional. This platform is biased and only used to ruin people‚Äôs careers when they disagree with the ‚Äúmobs‚Äù that attack others in droves on Twitter."
twitter,us,8.54,1,"Just watched Steven Crowder‚Äôs video that Twitter just removed his video on ‚ÄúVoter Fraud‚Äù.

He posted it today on Feb 24, 2021. You can say it‚Äôs his own opinion but Twitter hates your opinion!

They‚Äôre better apps like Twitter! Trust me!

Matter in fact, make your own social media app and be better than Twitter!"
twitter,us,8.54,5,Twitter definitely the best social media app out and it‚Äôs not even close!

twitter,us,8.54,2,"According to Twitter free speech is relative. And their system is flawed in that bots can be created within it. They‚Äôre cracking down on anyone with a strong opinion Left or Right. They‚Äôre cracking down on nudity or other adult images, i.e., violent images. This app was awesome before 2016. Now it‚Äôs a shell. But as long as ppl are entertained they‚Äôll be distracted. I‚Äôve been banned many times for expressing myself. If you told me that I was in a nation with strict censorship and it was the gov who banned me I would‚Äôve believed you. But I‚Äôm an American and I don‚Äôt have any doubt who‚Äôs responsible for removing me from speaking as freely as citizens did in coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries. Unfortunately twitter holds a monopoly on dialogue. I can‚Äôt wait for the next big thing. Cuz twitter is played out"
twitter,us,8.54,1,On my first day using Twitter I was blocked from any interaction after 5 Tweets. It‚Äôs almost been a week and 2 help request later. Still nothing?
twitter,us,8.54,5,Fantastic platform for free speech and to get free daily news on current affairs. Promotes love and connects people from different walks of life. Really appreciate the app! Thanks.
twitter,us,8.54,1,I am being shadow banned for my opinion. I did a test with my followers not one seen my Tweet. Every other Tweet on my timeline is an Ad.

twitter,us,8.54,3,"My account got suspended last week, and Twitter's support has not gotten back to me, even though I've filed an appeal about eight times already."
twitter,us,8.54,1,Wish it could be zero stars for a platform form that restricts free speech.
twitter,us,8.54,1,"Twitter has systematically frozen out people that don't share their beliefs.  Twitter has put me in twitter jail for mirroring liberals and Democratic ideology, but on the conservatives side. For the  same things they the liberals and Democrats have said. Twitter has frustrated me to the point that I rarely get on twitter anymore. It‚Äôs a good day on Twitter when you aren‚Äôt singled out for your beliefs.Twitter officials need to-be banned for their harassment for their Bias!"
twitter,us,8.54,1,"If you want a safe space for group thinkers who all think the same and will cancel anyone with opinions differing from theirs, you found it in Twitter! Snowflakes unite!"
twitter,us,8.54,1,It‚Äôs a shame that someone with a different viewpoint has to be shut down.
twitter,us,8.54,1,Twitter is on a slippery slope of socialism.
twitter,us,8.54,1,Your like an insecure girlfriend that needs a never-ending stream of compliments.
twitter,us,8.54,5,"I love the app, but posting videos to the app is a struggle. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I have an older iPhone but I see videos all the time on my TL, but I can‚Äôt post any. Would really love an explanation. Other than that, it‚Äôs a stellar app."
twitter,us,8.54,1,"Not only is content now curated to its users, even the reviews are removed that negatively  portray Twitter.  Good luck getting all those active users back on the platform."

twitter,us,8.54,3,"But that‚Äôs just not what we get anymore. I get hodgepodge of people with time stamps all over the place. These are the things that make me not want to spend time on it. I do love Twitter, though but just want more/different."
twitter,us,8.54,5,Thank you for removing certain people off Twitter the world and humanity thank you ....
twitter,us,8.54,5,Being able to communicate to all of these GREAT PEOPLE!!!!!!!!  Nobody is BETTER!!! Ok
twitter,us,8.54,1,"Why is there no setting to directly open links in the external browser?
First of all due to twitter‚Äôs proprietary link shortening the links don‚Äôt open in the app, then they have the gall to open it in that limited web view, then I have to go open it in safari, then I have to click on open in app to finally have the link opened where it was supposed to in the first place.
HORRIBLE User Experience."
twitter,us,8.54,5,Thank you for making this experience. I usually stay away from people online and especially IRL ( In Real Life) so thank you for making this Twitter app easy to navigate and taking care of us who have very few outlets.
twitter,us,8.54,1,Your pompous method of censorship has ruined our republic of America.  Shame on you.  You have no intrinsic rights to judging what is right or true.  You will eventually be abandoned and will deserve it for being a commie globalist and anti American.
twitter,us,8.54,5,Love it
twitter,us,8.54,1,Stop being biased against conservatism and Christianity
twitter,us,8.54,3,I wish Twitter would do more to let us know that someone has followed us. Lately it‚Äôs been harder to gain followers bc the person doesn‚Äôt even realize you followed them.
twitter,us,8.54,1,Twitter suspended me and a lot of my friends for ‚Äúexploiting and spamming‚Äù when all we did was reply to tweets and stuff like that aka being normal on Twitter. They won‚Äôt respond to my appeals and I can not make account.

twitter,us,8.54,1,"This issue could be an iOS problem, buts it‚Äôs REALLY PREVALENT on the Twitter app. Every time I am scrolling in the app on the iPhone, while I‚Äôll be listening to audio on the iPad, and every time I scroll by by any picture or open any message, the app forces the audio output (Bluetooth headphones) to pull away from my iPad and forces them to connect to the iPhone. This is EXTREMELY ANNOYING!!! I swear the only reason I have not deleted the app yet is because it is useful to communicate people don‚Äôt use other SNS apps."
twitter,us,8.54,4,"Twitter App is 1 million times better that Facebook but I have a personal issue I have been trying to delete this account and they don‚Äôt let me they holding me without right also they are inside of my Apple iPad meaning someone from far they  uninstall my Twitter app After a while they put them back I don‚Äôt know this is a political field member or someone else in the Law whoever it is is breaking the law OK why are you do this to me why are you holding this account I am nobody but anyway also I cannot do translating meaning I can‚Äôt seem translation 
Thank you for your attention 
Everything else is great 
Truly. ABC"
twitter,us,8.54,1,Recently started this thing where when you click a picture it opens the tweet instead of the picture. Also you can mute hashtags of topics you don‚Äôt want to see but once they add one of those stupid emojis at the end it‚Äôs unmutable.
twitter,us,8.54,1,"My account was suspended a month ago and I have no clue why. I searched through my feed and found nothing that would warrant this. I do not speak harshly to others or threaten violence. They said it was because of spam or manipulative behavior. Anyone can go through my feed and see that there was no spam, no manipulative behavior. I have no clue what they are talking about they just suspended my account for nothing. Their support is a joke! I have written the multiple emails and gotten the same stupid generic email back that they will review my complaintAnd get back with me within a few days. If I write a new one they stated they will attach it to the original complaint. That was a month ago and I still have nothing! You don‚Äôt fix anything by censoring people! Let people have open discussions and decide for themselves!"
twitter,us,8.54,5,Made life better

But if you speak in clich√© as I do, for instance saying that Marco Rubio needs to go jump off a bridge, you‚Äôre likely to be banned which I have been for those exact words. I do understand what is at issue with that comment, I don‚Äôt think that Twitter understands that people do speak in clich√© and to be taken literally is taken incorrectly."

Too much reading negative stuff that's relatable is dangerous for humans there should always be a mixture of both but 100% more motivational relatable and happy uplifting.

Long story short i had my account for 10 years and i switched to a new phone but couldnt log in because their 2FA doesnt sometimes doesnt send out codes, idk whats the point of the system if it doesnt work. Just if yu plan using this app, dont add 2FA"
twitter,us,8.54,3,First off they always hitting me with the robot thing with my number it annoying now Like any other app like Snapchat or Instagram don‚Äôt got it feel like Twitter have to remove it for good other then that the app is a solid 7/10.
twitter,us,8.54,1,"I believe in Christianity and how it‚Äôs the truth. Not that I don‚Äôt hate the people who are LGBTQ, and who believe in Heroscope which it seems like it‚Äôs pushed more and more often. seems like all social media platforms are not interested in Christianity anymore. And I feel like the truth (Christianity) isn‚Äôt what most people like. Which not all people have to believe in it. It‚Äôs just like, can we be included too? I love all neighbors but just like all social media platforms aren‚Äôt giving us Christians a voice when we are told in school to have one."
twitter,us,8.54,4,"Twitter is not as easily ‚Äòmanageable‚Äô in the current iteration, as it was before changes were made in format."
twitter,us,8.54,5,"IT‚ÄôS ABOUT TIME YOU KICKED CRIMINAL TRUMP & OTHERS OFF TWEETER, ALL HIS LIES CREATED THE INSURRECTION AT OUR NATION‚ÄôS CAPITOL. GOOD FOR YOU AND KEEP PEOPLE LIKE TRUMP OFF FOR GOOD!!!!!!"
twitter,us,8.54,5,Fantastic
twitter,us,8.54,5,Best app!
twitter,us,8.54,1,"I have lost over 5,000 follower and those whom followed. You are fascist."
twitter,us,8.54,5,Ok
twitter,us,8.54,1,This fleet thing is stupid. I don‚Äôt care if other apps use it I don‚Äôt want this weird window open at the top of my Twitter feed I don‚Äôt use. I deleted Twitter and I‚Äôm done for good.
twitter,us,8.54,1,"If you like being suppressed, silenced and stomped into the ground, then twitter is the app for you. 

I‚Äôm running FOR UNITED STATES SENATE NEXT YEAR but because I‚Äôm a Republican, twitter is suppressing my account. 

How do I know? There‚Äôs websites you can go to and input your username and they run tests. 

Have I reported this to twitter? YES. A LOT. 

Do they care? No. No they don‚Äôt. 

Will I make laws that are so strict with fines so big this never, ever happens again when I‚Äôm elected? Yes. Will I break up twitter and Facebook for helping steal the 2020 election? Yes."
twitter,us,8.54,2,They banned trump now the snowflakes are loose
twitter,us,8.54,1,"I truly read it so seldom and afterwards I am amazed.  I read people writing such hateful remarks, truly awful.  They spout out  enough toward others   It is so distasteful  then I think who are these people?  Am I standing near them in grocery stores, etc?"
twitter,us,8.54,5,love it
twitter,us,8.54,1,I‚Äôve been trying over the past 2 hours trying to re sign in my existing account I‚Äôve did everything they told me to do
twitter,us,8.54,1,Only putting one star so the issue can be solved faster. Twitter has consistently had a problem with deleting likes but recently it‚Äôs been more frequent and high percentages. Many times I will like a post and a few days later I notice Twitter has unliked it for me. I just saw a tweet drop 60k likes. This problem is easily fixable and needs to be addressed.
twitter,us,8.54,1,"You can‚Äôt silence people for their opinions. The internet and social media is the new public forum. Meanwhile BLM, Antifa, and other liberal domestic violence groups and speech are totally allowed, but if you are on the right and stand for moral decency ‚Äúoops‚Äù banned. Another example of the disgusting wave of public censorship and hijacking of the American idea."
twitter,us,8.54,1,Bad unless you have someone you talk to then it‚Äôs slightly better. Also it‚Äôs your fault for asking for a review üòéüòéüòé
twitter,us,8.54,1,You deleted everyone. Now it‚Äôs boring. Bad business.
twitter,us,8.54,1,If you want to be on Twitter you better conform!!!  Differing opinions not allowed & will be censored.
twitter,us,8.54,5,"The best app evaaaah! Periodddt! Beta than fb, ig, whatevs u name it ü•≥"
twitter,us,8.54,4,could use less advertisements
twitter,us,8.54,2,It is unethical and immoral to censor political views you do not agree with and then leave child porn and terrorists on your media unchecked.
twitter,us,8.54,1,"I don‚Äôt care who you are, you have to admit Twitter is the most biased and toxic social media platform there is. If you‚Äôre a left leaning celebrity you could literally get away with murder but on the other hand if you‚Äôre even slightly politically conservative and say literally anything, you will be banned without warning or details as to why you‚Äôve been banned. I use Twitter for memes but it‚Äôs a terrible platform otherwise."
twitter,us,8.54,5,"Clean interface, real-time content. Good user experience."
twitter,us,8.54,3,I don‚Äôt have followers
twitter,us,8.54,5,Great app great graphics great people. I didn‚Äôt use Twitter before that much but I really like it.
twitter,us,8.54,1,1 star due to hosting Orange Chicken
twitter,us,8.54,5,I like Twitter and I hope you allow us to write more word thanks keep it up
twitter,us,8.54,2,Excellent social media platform significantly debased by its selective censorship and propensity to only promote left-leaning accounts and stories. Unfortunately freedom of speech and a balanced distribution of information is kind of a big deal to me.
twitter,us,8.54,1,So much pain
twitter,us,8.54,1,Very disappointed in Twitter.
twitter,us,8.54,1,"I got back on Twitter because I needed to communicate with our water system about the water outage, I‚Äôm from Texas.  Today I see this and other posts and I remember why I left Twitter.  I haven‚Äôt missed it one iota but I do miss my Parler."
twitter,us,8.54,1,App isn‚Äôt anything but nazi liberals. Only promote the lefts agenda.
twitter,us,8.54,1,"Twitter is notorious for a reason. Populated by toxic people of all political persuasions, the operators of the service itself participate in editorial decisions by censoring some bad actors but encouraging others to go on being abusive, racist, or otherwise evil. Their decisions demonstrate that they don't mind racism or violence so long as the correct people engage in it. Further, Twitter actively engages in suppression of any competing service in an attempt to be sure they control the most public discourse possible."
twitter,us,8.54,3,i cant see my fleets. i have deleted the app multiple times and when i opened the app they show up but the second i close out the app they disappear! i don‚Äôt know if i missed something but they don‚Äôt show for me unfortunately
twitter,us,8.54,5,Da best
twitter,us,8.54,1,Bunch of hacks that use Twitter to speak their mind without having to face reality and speak their mind WITH an honest response back.  Own up to your words and be fair. Twitter has facilitated a mob culture.
twitter,us,8.54,5,"Love This App And Everyone On It
Almost No Restrictions So You Really Feel Free Here."
twitter,us,8.54,5,Great multimedia site
twitter,us,8.54,5,üëçüçÄ‚òÆÔ∏è
twitter,us,8.54,5,How does one voice tweet? I still can‚Äôt voice tweet. I am upset :(
twitter,us,8.54,5,Good
twitter,us,8.54,1,Twitter I wish your 320 or 230 at waiver that is with disappear you‚Äôre nothing but a censorship ideaology. Who cares less about America.
twitter,us,8.54,3,"I gave this app a 3 stars for a couple of reasons. The app overall is a great app works great yes. But all the people on the app is app is a problem. People will cancel people for things from years ago or recently. Even if someone apologizes for what they did, these people send death threats and other non appropriate things. That is a big reason I give it a 3 star rating."
twitter,us,8.54,5,"Don‚Äôt install, you will only have pain on this app. Would recommend"
twitter,us,8.54,1,I love the app but since trump is on it nvm
twitter,us,8.54,1,its a hellscape if toxicity and if there was an iceberg chart the things that would be the darkest on other platforms would be just below the surface. people group up together to ‚Äúcancel‚Äù wholesome people and creators simply to get more followers and when there is someone who is actually problematic instead of doing what the system was created to do where they are supposed to deplatform problematic people the cancel culture turns a blind eye. this app took so much of my time and its bound to take so much more but holy crap i hate this platform so much
twitter,us,8.54,1,Keep all free speech or give up any government protections to avoid lawsuits......hypocrisy
twitter,us,8.54,1,Twitter suppresses conservative thought.  Shame on you for deleting the MyPillow account.  And where‚Äôs Eric Carmin??????
twitter,us,8.54,2,To much cancel culture on this platform.  Needs to be more American friendly. This is America and you should literally be able to say whatever you desire.
twitter,us,8.54,1,Once a fun menace now a boring menace.
twitter,us,8.54,5,Funniest app ever
twitter,us,8.54,5,Lit. That‚Äôs it. Lit
twitter,us,8.54,1,As of lately there‚Äôs been a bug that takes me out of group chat dms whenever I‚Äôm typing. So I have to tap the group chat icon to get back in and it crashes the dms immediately when the keyboard comes up as I start typing. Also when I‚Äôm trying to send a video or a picture once I hit send it takes me out of the groupchat and to the messages list and I have to type my message and try to resend my picture all over again.
twitter,us,8.54,5,Twitter and nothing else
twitter,us,8.54,1,Twitter regularly censors conservatives for a lot less than they do liberals. You already know this of course.
twitter,us,8.54,1,I updated my phone to iOS 14.4 and I can‚Äôt log in to my Twitter account since then..I wanna know if there‚Äôs anything to do with my update. I can‚Äôt from my browser too
twitter,us,8.54,1,"Using password manager on Twitter with iPad is completely dysfunctional. It needs some serious reworking. 
I can make it work perfectly fine on my mac. 
On iPad, I can‚Äôt get the password to generate when I want that. When a field is selected to use the password, that‚Äôs when it calls the generate password function, instead of calling the existing password! 
So you can see what happens next. Newly generated passwords won‚Äôt work in that field, then whatever I choose, the iOS dialogue pop up will appear asking if I want to save that new password, and I‚Äôll be screwed if I accidentally let it save a non-functioning password. 
Fix this!"
twitter,us,8.54,1,This ridiculous app removed the oval pawfice account because some deranged right wing idiots complained about a dog. This is the same app that allowed dementia ridden trump to run an insurrection. Make me understand how you came to this conclusion and action to remove a dog account but let trump attempt to overthrow the government and kill then go Pence!
twitter,us,8.54,4,I like the program.  I just wish there was a common rules or user agreement to cancel people who violate. It took too long to kick the last Administration and followers off.   They all put out too much mis-information. I feel they should have been kicked off sooner.
twitter,us,8.54,1,"I have togged the setting to sync contacts 5+ times, deleted and reinstalled 5+ times, checked all privacy/contact settings on my iPhone, waited days for Twitter to sync my contacts, but NOTHING has worked. How am I supposed to follow my friends or be found if my contacts don‚Äôt show up...? It defeats the purpose of having a Twitter. Please fix this otherwise I‚Äôll be part of your churn statistics"
twitter,us,8.54,1,Report the news Stop the political attacks we are all Americans
twitter,us,8.54,1,"Nothing is more desperate and despicable than purposely misleading the people of your nation, in order to gain more power. You can believe literally nothing this platform represents."
twitter,us,8.54,4,Merci pour tout !
twitter,us,8.54,2,"Often, my timeline goes blank and asks if I want to start following people to start my feed. I have to close the app and restart. The occurrence has grown more and more frequent the past month or so. I‚Äôm not sure if this happens on purpose to increase the following of the celebrities on the ensuing ‚Äúsuggested people‚Äù page. It is just hard to imagine a company as advanced as Twitter has pages and timelines crashing routinely for no reason.

Maybe my phone is prone to technical issues with certain apps and it may have nothing to do you, but It‚Äôs frustrating. Thank you for letting me talk to you about it.
 God bless you.

twitter,us,8.54,1,"It‚Äôd be a WONDERFUL place if EVERYONE had the same rights to speak and to be heard. It‚Äôs a shame people feel threatened by opinions that do not match their own. What a boring world if everyone thought alike, but I feel that Twitter will only be happy when that is the case. VERY SAD! Taking our followers away and fact checking facts with lies is also a problem. At least play fair and treat us like we all have discernment and our own brain! We don‚Äôt need your opinion when expressing our own. üò≥ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

twitter,us,8.54,5,It‚Äôs amazing
twitter,us,8.54,1,Its doing more harm than good
twitter,us,8.54,1,UNBELIEVABLY BIAS AND SO LEFT WING. ALL THE FAMN TUOTS THAT WENT ON ALL LAST YEAR AND TWITTER CONCENTRATE MS ON ‚ÄúONLY‚Äù  CAPITAL HILL. YOU ONLY ALLOW YOUR VIEWS AND OPINIONS.

twitter,us,8.54,5,I love it
twitter,us,8.54,1,Twitter allows some people to be vulgar and ugly yet suspends accounts when others fire back so be careful in thinking that everyone is given fair treatment because that‚Äôs certainly not the case!
twitter,us,8.54,1,Be careful what you wish for /Twitter and Big tech will take your freedoms and your letting them
twitter,us,8.54,5,Love Twitter been here since the  beginning
twitter,us,8.54,1,I‚Äôm deactivating my account because you censor people who disagree with you politically. What you‚Äôve done is un-American. Obviously an unfriendly environment for a majority portion of America. üá∫üá∏

twitter,us,8.54,1,Twitter censorship is not appreciated when it affects legitimate political views
twitter,us,8.54,1,You won‚Äôt find freedom to express yourself on Twitter. There remains some entertainment value here but it has gone downhill fast. As a result I have curtailed my Twitter Time.

twitter,us,8.54,1,"i'm from east europe, grown up in a communist system, now even you born in the free world can have a taste how censorship is."
twitter,us,8.54,5,I love Tweeter and follow realizable source of information! At the same time some funny stuff to cheer one especially during this tense times. Thanks for being vigilant in censoring inaccurate info and not tolerating hateful tweets!

twitter,us,8.54,1,"Chicken Jack Dorsey and his thought police minions ought the be tarred and feathered for what they have done to free speech and free expression in the country.  Thankfully, every dog has his day."
twitter,us,8.54,1,Give us back our free speech and quit being partisan
twitter,us,8.54,1,One of the main contributors to the downfall of society. People thinking they know everything and people reacting thinking they know everything creates war.
twitter,us,8.54,4,"The app is great, but after the latest update, it‚Äôs almost impossible to open pictures from the home feed. For some reason whenever I tap on the picture, instead of opening the picture like it used to, it opens the tweet as if I tapped on the field surrounding the picture. This is frustrating and I would like it to go back. Thanks!"
twitter,us,8.54,1,Do not use Twitter. They are censoring too many people and that is un-American
twitter,us,8.54,1,"There actions speak for themselves Support freedom, dump Twitter"
twitter,us,8.54,5,Just perfect.
twitter,us,8.54,1,I was hacked and I contacted you guys to unhack it or do something about it. Never heard a reply and five years later the individual using the account posted inappropriate material...I just love how that was okay and now you are silencing people for just sharing material that is their own opinion. You guys are terrible.
twitter,us,8.54,1,The censoring has git to stop. Terrible experience.
twitter,us,8.54,1,Unreliable fact checks

twitter,us,8.54,3,No too thrilled about being banned for repeating what others said first. It‚Äôs a bit hypocritical. Not a decent defender of the first Amendment.
twitter,us,8.54,1,Great app but terrible support when you get suspended. And you can get suspended for nothing.
twitter,us,8.54,1,You can‚Äôt delete accounts just because you don‚Äôt agree with the post especially when it comes to politics. They are clearly targeting a certain political party they don‚Äôt like. I am not even that political but blocking parties you don‚Äôt agree with when it doesn‚Äôt involve hate speech or racism shouldn‚Äôt be blocked bc it infringes on freedom of speech and only pushes one narrative.

twitter,us,8.54,1,"In my opinion, Twitter likes to censor those they find that does not align with their view. They are a fine representation of the cancel culture going on in America. I think Twitter is fearful to allow all forms of free speech because they align with the liberal sewer"
twitter,us,8.54,1,"It‚Äôs discriminatory unless you agree with their philosophy and moral theories in life. It‚Äôs now officially beginning to persecute the church, he believers, those who oppose and think differently. And bc of its power - it will not end and will destroy many"
twitter,us,8.54,1,"Twitter is a hate-filled slog. There are some smart and thoughtful folks worth following, but most of Twitter is a free for all of dumb and mean. They allow the likes of Jim Jordan and Trump junior to spew lies and bile. Yet they ban folks for calling out these people. Very inconsistent. Hypocritical and a waste of time. Instead of Twitter, go volunteer or read a good book."
twitter,us,8.54,4,"I like portal but for speaking their opinions isn‚Äôt right.  How many #illicit contents are #allowed by media are worse than just opinions and summaries of news ?

twitter,us,8.54,1,"Twitter brings out the worst in people. This is a place people go to celebrate other people‚Äôs deaths. The idea that you can have humans or machines police this discourse and weed out ‚Äúhate‚Äù is laughable. You just weed out the opinions you don‚Äôt like. If the notion that we have implicit biases is correct, then this is true, even if your employees have the best intentions, and I am not sure that they do. How can you possibly justify your censorship of the New York Post based on a story that was corroborated and based on documents, when you had never done anything similar for other publications, no matter how much uncorroborated garbage they published? I will continue to come here as long as some decent reporters and analysts have accounts, but I am not sure how long that will last."

twitter,us,8.54,1,"Created as a bastion for free speech, u are now an Orwellian censoring disaster. 
You should be ashamed of the direction the company has gone. 
You assume so many lack intelligence, when it is your decisions that reflect a lack of thought. 

I could go on and on, but your self-righteousness as a company leads me to believe it‚Äôs a waste of time. Problems can‚Äôt be fixed until they are first acknowledged and identified. Do much better."
twitter,us,8.54,5,My bad i was a kid
twitter,us,8.54,5,"Yea, it‚Äôs happening on this app"
twitter,us,8.54,1,"I have been suspended without reason. Is it permanent? Three years of harassment and now they won‚Äôt even let me delete! 
Shadowbanning. Throttling. Suspension."
twitter,us,8.54,5,"If you follow the right people, Twitter is great comedy."
twitter,us,8.54,1,Censorship = twitter
twitter,us,8.54,5,"Excellent format for efficient expression.

Fits my style to organize as I see fit.

Interactions with others whenever desired, or not.

So much better w/o Trumpty-Dumpty."
twitter,us,8.54,1,Don‚Äôt like that conservatives are silenced. No freedom of speech is biased and has a liberal agenda.
twitter,us,8.54,1,Oh I‚Äôm allowed my second amendment rights to free speech if I‚Äôm reviewing your wretched site? Lol very rich you loser Democrats are all the same corrupt and hypocritical
twitter,us,8.54,5,Love Twitter. I mostly read the comments. People crack me up. They are so funny. Restores one‚Äôs faith in humanity.
twitter,us,8.54,5,Is there any way you will let me back on Twitter in for one chance that's all. I will follow all. rules and will not use other platforms I will even delete them one chance
twitter,us,8.54,2,What do you actually update with your software updates‚Ä¶ The ability to continue to manipulate and censor people you don‚Äôt agree with?
twitter,us,8.54,1,When I try to create a account and when I try to put my birthday it won‚Äôt even let me nothing will let me type or anything and I‚Äôve tried deleting it and downloading it again and nothing works.
twitter,us,8.54,1,"Twitter is a waste of time.   Its a one sided echo chamber.   If you don‚Äôt agree or say something they dont like your gone, whether its backed by evidence or not.   I prefer to listen to all perspectives and draw my own conclusions and this is frowned upon on twitter."
twitter,us,8.54,2,Your company should try harder to be less biased towards conservative view points it would be more enjoyable to use Twitter that way
twitter,us,8.54,1,Locked out of my account and when I reset the password I‚Äôm then not able to log in with the new password.
twitter,us,8.54,1,They ban conservatives. No free speech here

twitter,us,8.54,1,This app continues to allow people to make fake accounts and harass people without repercussions. You should not be allowed to assassinate someone‚Äôs character. This doesn‚Äôt even pertain to me. It‚Äôs what I see everyday on here.
twitter,us,8.54,4,"I love Twitter and everything, especially with the new changes you all have made on the app, though some things are a little confusing with the reply thing, and so on, but I believe you all should possibly consider the idea of making an edit button so people can go back into their tweets/replies if they notice a mistake instead of having to delete the whole thing and redoing it. I feel like it would be helpful in the long run and have more people coming in and liking Twitter more if it had the small edit button for tweets/replies"
twitter,us,8.54,1,Everyone here is so sensitive that cant tell a joke from a death threat. Unless you want to be burned at the steak for saying ‚Äúguys I don‚Äôt really like kpop.‚Äù I would not bother.

twitter,us,8.53,1,Stop silencing the right.  There has to be balance to your idiocy.
twitter,us,8.53,1,I prefer telegram because I don‚Äôt like all the political games Twitter plays. It they were non bias I‚Äôd use them more than once a month. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to friends or family. To control I g if you don‚Äôt share their views! Feel they shouldn‚Äôt silence conservatives! Need to allow people to express themselves... we aren‚Äôt under communist control but Twitter feels that way so I don‚Äôt use often!
twitter,us,8.53,2,You should not be censoring conservatives or anyone else
twitter,us,8.53,1,This app is garbage always says ‚ÄúTweets are failing to load‚Äù delete and reinstall and the same thing happens.
twitter,us,8.53,5,"I like this media , like it so much"

twitter,us,8.53,1,Where is our first amendment rights?   Forgot liberals don‚Äôt allow that for conservatives.
twitter,us,8.53,1,"Its a controlled experience, point of views that don‚Äôt  align with Government officials, and left-leaning ideologies but particularly democrats are usually suppressed.

I‚Äôve watched certain tweets labeled as false while other accounts literally spew falsehoods and aren‚Äôt labeled as such, with the same reach.

I‚Äôve had accounts that have grown significantly then go stale with no interaction and can usually be traced back to tweets with obvious opposition to the political left."
twitter,us,8.53,1,I like free speech! ‚ù§Ô∏èPresident Trump
twitter,us,8.53,1,These twits are social police. They decide what nasty crap is acceptable and what nasty crap is not. I received a warning from the Twitter Police the other day. And don‚Äôt buy their stock!! Terrible investment.

twitter,us,8.53,4,"How do you log out on the app?  Doesn‚Äôt seem like an option.  4 stars, not 5."

twitter,us,8.53,5,"I love how free u can be. Speak ur mind, share personal and intimate content."
twitter,us,8.53,1,"The app is fun and easy to use however it‚Äôs annoying that it asks for a phone number verification, I sign up with email, I don‚Äôt enter a phone number because I don‚Äôt have one that I can use for it. However my account features gets limited because I don‚Äôt have a phone number and it won‚Äôt let me in unless I verify a phone number. Twitter keeps randomly locking my accounts when I haven‚Äôt done anything on them üòê."
twitter,us,8.53,5,All I see are memes

twitter,us,8.53,5,"Twitter, for all its faults, is still a good source of the latest news, not gossip or conspiracy theory, that the mainstream media decides not to publish."
twitter,us,8.53,4,"Your format is impeccable. Your cancellation of conservative individuals & corporations, suppression of factual news, is immoral, a violation to the Constitution. Starving Parler out should be illegal (anti-trust). Rather than you in partnership with the far Left continuing to destroy our core American values üá∫üá∏üíîhome base your empire where your ideology is welcomed: Chinaüá®üá≥Russiaüá∑üá∫Venezuelaüáªüá™State run Media, law enforcement & Riots; Citizen submission, Property & wealth confiscation, pre-determined election results...A Socialism Utopia."
twitter,us,8.53,2,The validation code was not sent by text messages and I can't enter my account. The secret word was changed and it didn't work.
twitter,us,8.53,1,"I‚Äôve grown as a creator recently, and I love to interact with my fans. But I‚Äôm constantly put in twitter jail for hitting the dm limit. It‚Äôs unreasonable and the punishment is too harsh. Why do I have to wait 24 hours for a major part of an app? Even if the limit was reduced to 1 hour things would be so much better!! Creators could interact with their fans more and people could actually have conversations with their friends instead having to use a different platform."
twitter,us,8.53,5,"This company is worth much more than presently valued. I‚Äôm late to the game but hey, I‚Äôm here now."
twitter,us,8.53,3,"I follow over 100 people but I only see tweets from about 30 of them. Not only that, but Twitter is constantly recommending and showing me tweets from those whom I follow are following OR topics OR just likes of the people I follow no matter how many times I say I‚Äôm not interested and it just frustrates me. I would just like to see the content I follow other people for and that is it."
twitter,us,8.53,1,Targeted shadow banning and suspensions based on political affiliation and ideology is very un-American and should not be tolerated. Twitter is guilty of this.
twitter,us,8.53,1,"Twitter doesn‚Äôt care about anyone. They care about their own agenda. What kinda ‚ÄúAmerican loving‚Äù business silences the President of the United States?? That‚Äôs beyond absurd. 

I also would like to know why twitter and Apple won‚Äôt allow me to delete this app?? It will ALSO not let me delete my personal information OR delete the account all together... why? I want twitter to delete all my personal information and remove my accounts from your servers. I cannot use a product that denies Americans their god given rights."
twitter,us,8.53,1,"Well since I was asked to give a review, why not? This is the most toxic, hate-spewing platform. If it weren‚Äôt still following news from a handful of my favorite vendors, I would have left a long time ago like I did that other platform. No wonder mental health issues are rampant right now. Stay away from the Trending tab at all costs."
twitter,us,8.53,2,"Primero que todo me gusta mucho twitter.pero soy cubano y cuba vive una dictadura  donde no hay libertad de expresi√≥n, si sabes lo que es. Todos lo dirigentes corruptos tienen cuentas en twitter y ahora resulta que si tu le dices lo que piensas en sus caras es mensaje de odio. Anal√≠zate twitter. Necesitamos democracia para Cuba y necesitamos tu ayuda Gracias"
twitter,us,8.53,1,"I hate Twitter due to it blocking free speech for only conservatives but allowing liberals to spew hate & incite violence. BLM is a hate group that spreads evil, racism, & is tearing apart our country, while Twitter bows down to them. The only reason I joined was to follow and support the ones who are fighting this madness. Stop taking away freedoms of half the population, Twitter. Love harder than you hate and we can change the world."
twitter,us,8.53,1,Used to be great- now it is filled with ads and tweets show up a day late. Management has ruined this app.
twitter,us,8.53,4,"Now that some of the misinformation and extremism has been banned, Twitter is far more enjoyable. Thank you!"
twitter,us,8.53,1,The bias here is purely un-American and disgusting.  Thanks for asking.
twitter,us,8.53,1,"If you say anything controversial or anything resembling a different opinion from the masses, expect to have your voice filtered and extreme prejudice from users. So much for free speech right?"

Maybe have the logo button in this case scroll to the most recent batch of loaded tweets.  That‚Äôd be greeeeaat"
twitter,ca,8.48,1,"Really, is this Twitter? one of the most laughable social media platforms. If your website and interface wasn‚Äôt messy enough (you never really dis work on it), i am SO angry at you. 

Like do people work for Twitter? Anyone? Humans? Why did it take me exactly 24mins to do ANYTHING? Your options are all jumble, so many options where the hyperlink leads to nowhere, and thats when its not a back and forth sent between you real site, the mobile one and the mobile APP. Legit at some point I HAD to go on Google... because I was stuck for almost 10mins being sent to each site backto back.

twitter,ca,8.48,2,It is not acceptable that we cannot erase all the likes above the 3200 limit that you impose on the users. I am currently looking for work and I had to clean all my tweets. But why limit the past likes? This is certainly not democratic especially when you claim to be defending freedom of expression.

If Twitter can effect the political structure of the United States directly, in order to gain support and policy in their favour, how can they effect politics on an international level. It seems they don‚Äôt police their community equally, and in the way they propegate certain narratives they change the political climate to suit themselves, and what suits a multibilluon dollar international corporation I doubt will suit poor small town people. And this goes beyond Canada and the unites states, this issue presses forth into the Easter sovereign states as well. Not only this, but by removing what they deem offensive on one side and not the other, they have negated the ability for discourse inciting violence- by means of allowing things such as #hangmikepence, over things as #maga. This propagates a false narrative, and also pushes people rather than to speak out on this media platform, to act out in the streets in order to be heard. I can‚Äôt believe this will In any western country be a benefit to civility or the lives of the average person, and has concentrated this application into an echo chamber of ideas from one ideology without any pushback, whilst silencing opposing positions. This is very frightful, considering they are attempting to dismantle other more bipartisan social applications as well, saturating the market with solely themselves.

twitter,ca,8.48,1,"Twitter allows violent and hateful tweets from the left and others like Iran‚Äôs leaders, but unjustly censor the right. Section 230 must be changed and no longer protect this monopoly and free speech infringer."
twitter,ca,8.48,1,"I was an avid Twitter, but after all the bill crap going on in the US I can see this company has no soul and I can‚Äôt support them anymore. Blocking ‚Äúyou know who‚Äù is a little late for me, he has killed more with his faults information about covid and the attack on the White House was the final straw for you Twitter?"

twitter,ca,8.48,1,Nasty app. It tried to delete every single post they don‚Äôt like
twitter,ca,8.48,1,Don‚Äôt like the censorship. Free speech is important in a free society.
twitter,ca,8.48,1,Shame

twitter,ca,8.48,5,I‚Äôm giving Twitter Five stars
twitter,ca,8.48,1,@jack is a pedophile supporter and freedom censor
twitter,ca,8.48,1,So unimpressed with this app & its attempt at silencing free speech - do not bother downloading it
twitter,ca,8.48,1,Twitter is against free speech and blocks anyone who doesn‚Äôt follow the Democrat/Socialist agenda
twitter,ca,8.48,1,Twitter removing Trump and many others under the guise they incite violence is a total bald face lie. Twitter is deep state controlled and it couldn‚Äôt be more obvious.
twitter,ca,8.48,5,5 stars for finally taking down accounts that spread lies and hatred!
twitter,ca,8.48,1,The radical left has Big Tech wrapper around their fingers

twitter,ca,8.48,1,When a platform like Twitter is so widespread it almost becomes a right when majority of people obtain knowledge about their country from the presidents Twitter account how is it possible to censor the ruler of a country it just isn‚Äôt right and they choose what gets out to the public and what doesn‚Äôt. If there is something they don‚Äôt want the whole world knowing about the remove the tweet suspend accounts etc. You can get banned for getting someone‚Äôs gender wrong and in a sense they they took away your freedom of speech doing so. In real life you can call your friend or anyone whatever there may be consequences there may not you can call your friend all sorts of swearwords it‚Äôs okay but the second you tweet ‚Äúinoperative content‚Äù it‚Äôs gets removed. Tough times create strong men strong men create good times good times Creat weak men weak men create tough times where in the cycle do you think we are

twitter,nz,8.54,4,"Very smooth to use, unlike Facebook"
twitter,nz,8.52.1,5,Love using this great app
twitter,nz,8.52.1,1,Twitter lately is acting more like a communist regime censoring well meaning people for not conforming to ‚Äúofficial‚Äù opinion.
twitter,nz,8.52.1,5,twitter is good for farmers. Thank you very much
twitter,nz,8.52,4,jameison_

twitter,nz,8.50,1,"As an infrastructure of the internet, Twitter kills voices that filthy Jack doesn‚Äôt like, but allows radical muslim terrorists share their hate speech. Disgusting"
twitter,nz,8.50,3,"Twitter really is an amazing platform and something I come to on the daily, updating me with everything I need to know not just in my own country but around the world. Let‚Äôs be real though, even though it‚Äôs a really good app there are things that could improve. My two main are adding 4K resolution to video uploads and also an editing button to tweets. 

1) Many people wish to upload higher quality videos but don‚Äôt bother since the video quality is always a downgrade when put on your site. Technology is continuously updating so social media platforms (in my opinion) should also try and do the same. No point having so many 4K videos on your phone but don‚Äôt want to share knowing there is no point.

2) I don‚Äôt see the editing button as a major concern but it can be annoying having a few errors in a tweet and having to delete it (depending on the amount of errors) because you can‚Äôt edit the tweet. Obviously there are negatives with this but there should also be a history button alongside, showing a timeline of changes that occurred with the edited tweet. This ensures if any negative tweets have happened (due to editing the tweet) and you‚Äôve interacted then your able to see the timeline, allowing you to make a decision whether to unlike, unshare or even unfollow or block. 

Again, this is an amazing app that I will continue to use as long as I like but I hope small changes are made and that Twitter becomes a better app to use."

But let‚Äôs also talk about the decision to get rid of the option for worldwide trends. Now more than ever, we need the option to know what is going on around the world and not just in our own backyard. We already had the option to explore trends in our country and the biggest trends from around the world so what exactly was the reason to get rid of worldwide trends and no longer give us an option? Do you ever actually listen to your user base or do you just do what you feel like. Because that mindset will be the downfall of this app."

Now today I can no longer see the time/clock on the top left hand side or the battery and WiFi icons on the top right hand side on any of the tabs I click whether it is on my Home page, search/trending and DMs. Which has only happened today.

twitter,nz,7.47,4,"I have been using Twitter for a long time now. I love everything about it; how quick you can respond to Tweets, how you can send photos, DM, follow up with the latest news as soon as they are released. Recently I DID have an issue with it. My account got locked because of ‚Äúsuspicious activity‚Äù but all I had to do was reset my password: simple, right? However I clicked the link in my emails that sends me to reset my password and all it did was take me back to the page telling me to check my email. I tried multiple ways to fix it. My last hope was contacting Twitter Support. Luckily they responded to my email within 24 hours (the quickest help I‚Äôve gotten from a major app) and they set me up again easy. 

In conclusion; although there was an issue with my use of the app, Twitter was quick to respond and was efficient. They even replied to my thank-you email with a ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome! Happy to help!‚Äù So in return I am writing this review.

I do recommend. Four stars."

I‚Äôd been logged into the app for about 45 seconds at this point. The app can now only be unlocked, apparently, if I give you my phone number.

A cynical person might think that you do this solely to mine phone numbers, especially as a quick search shows that this has happened to thousands of other new users recently. If I had wanted you to have my phone number, I wouldn‚Äôt have set up the account with an email address, would I? You‚Äôre not having my number, your app is deleted, and I‚Äôll stick with Facebook, cheers."

twitter,nz,7.26,2,"Twitter is normally my favourite social media platform

However, similar to what others have reported; after the last update, Twitter keeps cutting out - for no reason, triggering an ipad reboot
Other apps work fine.

I am not inclined to maintain updates with any app if it results in decreased versus better function. 

Twitter says this update is just for a few tweaks. Hmmm
That vague comment is no excuse for an update, and increases risks of decreased function.

When Twitter fixes its functionality, so it actually reliably stays on - then recommend an upgrade.

If Twitter was as unreliable due to repeatedly cutting out and triggering an iPad reboot every 10 minutes early on, it would have been a dead duck long ago

Given the number of complaints (as its likely only a fraction complain about things - they just stop using them) if this goes uncorrected much longer, Twitter in likely to encounter more drop off in use üëâüèº which is a shame as its a great social media platform."

twitter,nz,7.17.1,1,"The app only started crashing after the last update, which was meant to fix this exact problem! Sort it out!"
twitter,nz,7.15,1,All. The. Time. iPhone 5S & iPad 2
twitter,nz,7.15,2,"Constantly freezes for seconds at a time, rendering the app almost unusable"
twitter,nz,7.15,1,Wow you are advertising iPhone X
twitter,nz,7.14,1,Sick of reading tweets that are advertisements.
twitter,nz,7.14,3,"For some reason only when I use the twitter app, the wifi will disconnect. I‚Äôve tested with other apps and it‚Äôs only the twitter one. I can turn wifi back on via settings but it will cut out again after a couple minutes on the app."
twitter,nz,7.14,1,"Every time I use the app after 5 minutes or less my wifi disconnects, only happens on the Twitter app"
twitter,nz,7.12.1,5,rt
twitter,nz,7.12,5,Best app for social media as it doesn‚Äôt crash and doesn‚Äôt create any problem
twitter,nz,7.11.1,3,I love the app I‚Äôm on it everyday. With the new iOS update it doesn‚Äôt open from the last tweet I read. It opens with a tweet that I read a week ago and I find it very frustrating having to scroll for ages to find the new tweets. üëçüëçüò¨üò¨
twitter,nz,7.11,4,Twitter is an amazing app but recently its asking me to update my app but when I go into AppStore it just says open!
twitter,nz,7.8,5,It‚Äôs just like Facebook but without all the baby pictures and family trips to the beach that will spam your timeline. I use it probably more than Facebook but then again to each it‚Äôs own and twitter isn‚Äôt for everyone.
twitter,nz,7.8,5,Love Twitter. Great idea.
twitter,nz,7.8,1,"????

Still doesn‚Äôt work with the iOS update."
twitter,nz,7.8,3,"Twitter has grown on me, and it's really easy to on iOS. I like that I can change between accounts easily, and the lists function is useful. I've used other Twitter apps in the past, and still use Tweetdeck on a PC, but they have mostly gone obsolete. The iOS native app works well enough. 5 stars for reliability, ease of use and iOS presentation and integration.

Still relevant in 2017, but with the advent of ios11, they decided to withdraw support for Apple Watch, so I'm revising my review rating down to 3 stars."
twitter,nz,7.6,1,There's no menu as indicated in the release notes - and no word from Twitter support either
twitter,nz,7.5.1,4,Good app but they need to add a 'edit' button if u make a mistake
twitter,nz,7.4.1,5,...
twitter,nz,7.3.2,5,_
twitter,nz,7.3,1,"Latest update is buggy as hell with pictures not loading, have reinstalled app etc"

twitter,nz,6.71.1,1,Utter gutter of 21st century. Bye bye twitter
twitter,nz,6.78,1,"The most racist app, Twitter India political head has killed Twitter in India...RIP Twitter India & Rasheed"
twitter,nz,6.77,4,One of the accounts I follow is related to traffic. Due to handsfree requirements while driving it would be great if these tweets could be played via audio e.g. Using Siri.
twitter,nz,6.76,1,Twitter has ruined its reputation by choosing to take down content that doesn't serve its self interest. Very disappointing. Twitter could be so much more. Freedom is all or nothing!
twitter,nz,6.76,2,"Hating the repeating stories particularly through likes, Non chronological timeline, and new reply setting."
twitter,nz,6.76,5,enough said
twitter,nz,6.75.2,5,"It's hard to describe a platform that is so informative adaptable and easy to use without using clich√©.
It has become my news and information centre and is essential to my day."
twitter,nz,6.73.2,1,"Twitter has disabled my accounts 3 times because I call out the Jews, pointing out their tribes actions is NOT hate speech. HISTORY REVISION IS ESSENTIAL #therewerenogaschambers tgsnt.tv"
twitter,nz,6.73.2,1,The new update keeps crashing and wont let me 'download' it. Wth. Cant open the app
twitter,nz,6.71,1,the new updates are so ugly and annoying can we just go back to the old one damn
twitter,nz,6.69,4,Great app. Easy to use.
twitter,nz,6.68.1,4,Yup
twitter,nz,6.68.1,4,Little bit laggy but over all it's good  app
twitter,nz,6.68.1,5,Thanks to developers for this app.
twitter,nz,6.67,2,Twitter is not what it used to be
twitter,nz,6.66,1,when you try to reply using quick reply all that happens is the app opens
twitter,nz,6.64,2,I had to delete Twitter due to it crashing and when I reinstalled it I didn't get the latest update. Useless
twitter,nz,6.64,5,Amazingly quick updates. Keeps me posted with best news updates.
twitter,nz,6.64,1,"Okay so idk if twitter is either broken or there's something wrong with my phone, but I can't get back into my account. I reset my password twice and I still couldn't get in. It wouldn't even load anything. üòê"
twitter,nz,6.64,1,self explanatory
twitter,nz,6.63.1,5,"With each update comes more tools and ways to use this app! It's such a great place to connect, follow and be entertained. Could spend hours on here!!! Hopefully the 'moments' feature is available in New Zealand soon."
twitter,nz,6.62.1,3,"I got this thing where i get a PM and it shows at the top, but when i respond and press ‚Äùsend‚Äù it takes me to the app."
twitter,nz,6.61.1,4,"I love getting feeds from Twitter but for 3 years now I've been saying I'd like to have the option of getting every new tweet automatically instead of having to do so manually. Another thing I've noticed is that the trends are rather skewed towards entertainment instead of actual news, which is what I use Twitter for."
twitter,nz,6.60,1,What happened? Takes ages to update tweets! Please fix.
twitter,nz,6.60,3,"The app has slowed down, takes longer for the app to register that you've clicked on a tweet and when you click a tweet twice it loads twice. Terrible."
twitter,nz,6.59.3,4,"For the most part, easy to navigate and is very simple!"
twitter,nz,6.59.3,5,"Love this app,so much better than Facebook. Love how you can interact with people.Its great"
twitter,nz,6.59.2,2,"Everything was running sweet with my Twitter app, then since the latest update, every time I open the Twitter app it goes to the top of my feed, instead of the location where I left off, like it used to. I preferred it when it went back to the last location in my feed."
twitter,nz,6.56,2,"Guys, I found a bug where whenever I get a new follower, it says I have a notification but no new followers, just rehighlighting one from weeks ago, only way around this is to get a like or a mention and then the list updates.. DM me.
Cheers"
twitter,nz,6.55,2,"Keeps showing 1 new notification, but when I open the app there are none. Looks like it's not just me."
twitter,nz,6.55,2,"Keeps saying I have 1 notification, I have nothing waiting for me when I open the app. Close app & it reappears again. Driving me insane."
twitter,nz,6.54,3,I gave grown to like Twitter. But too much information!
twitter,nz,6.54,5,Good at handling multiple accounts but if they would bring back an iPad app for Tweetdeck that would be even better.
twitter,nz,6.54,4,It's an easy app to use so I like it.
twitter,nz,6.53.2,5,"Easy to use, use it more than the website."
twitter,nz,6.53.2,5,"Hello, I would just like to talk about the notification sound? Its kinda of bugging me how you guys changed the sound. I really wanted the 'tweet' notification sound back. We really should have an option to change it. Thank you for understanding"
twitter,nz,6.53.2,1,Checked my storage usage and this app was using 800 MB of data. More than any other app there is no way to clear the cache without deleting it. The developers need to fix this
twitter,nz,6.53.2,5,Choice app for what it does
twitter,nz,6.53.1,1,After I updated the app it won't open. It will crash as soon as its clicked on. Something needs fixing.
twitter,nz,6.53,1,Thank you. This latest update has left me unable to open the app as it crashes every time I open it. I've tried to uninstall and reinstall but it still doesn't work
twitter,nz,6.53,1,"Thanks for the latest update. As a result of the update, all my previously deleted DMs have come back. I'm not talking a day's worth. I'm talking six months worth! Kinda cranky right now ..."
twitter,nz,6.52,5,"runs fast around the world than the equator . Welcoming news , facts , fun and great information . FANTASTIC ."
twitter,nz,6.52,4,"I don't mind the Twitter updates but DON'T become like FB & FB messenger & update every month. 
I enjoy how you can send private messages without limits. But I just Twitter overall to send messages to family, friends & meeting new people across the globe when events are happening. 
I wouldn't mind Twitter having it's own checkin & or checkedout/havebeen @ button ... included in another update üëçüëç"
twitter,nz,6.50,1,Shows me tweets I don't want to see from people I don't want to follow.
twitter,nz,6.49,4,"Does all right, but still too prone to ads... I mean promoted tweets"
twitter,nz,6.47.1,1,I love Twitter but I find myself using other apps to access it because this app will always show notifications even if there aren't any! Drives me round the bend. Have deleted the app.
twitter,nz,6.46.1,3,... But the latest update has my background sounds crashing every time a video comes past on my timeline. #someonescrewedup
twitter,nz,6.45,3,Don't know if I would really use this if I wasn't bated in first.
twitter,nz,6.44,5,App royalty. Simply one of the best apps available.
twitter,nz,6.44,1,New version is awful to look at. I'll be going to another app.
twitter,nz,6.44,5,"Love Twitter but my notifications never update! I get the notification, but when I want to check them out, they're not there:( and I wish favs were still a thing!"
twitter,nz,6.44,4,"I'd really like to be able to save videos, because I want to be able to post them on other social media sites other than Twitter and Facebook. If I come across a video I like and I want to post it on Instagram say, I can't. can you add an Instagram button under the ""share"" option or just add a ""save video/gif"" button? thanks"
twitter,nz,6.43.1,5,Very easy to use n connect with the world!
twitter,nz,6.43.1,5,"Absolutely love it,it's a pleasure to have such a reliable app üëåüèªüëçüèªüëåüèª"
twitter,nz,6.43.1,5,Had by all
twitter,nz,6.43.1,4,Does pretty much everything it needs to.
twitter,nz,6.43.1,1,Went to update. Now its stuck on the 'loading'. üòû
twitter,nz,6.41.1,4,Really good for opinions and sharing stories.
twitter,nz,6.41.1,5,Great tool.
twitter,nz,6.39,1,"I understand the need to make Twitter look as simple as possible.
The Twitter development team need to understand that most people over 35 require vision assistance, and there are many other people beyond that group, with visual impairment.
Making this version of Twitter so difficult to distinguish what is where is not a good way to show acceptance of all Twitter users.
It's practically an insult.
There needs to be more variation between controls, different areas, & things that react differently - like having a coloured header bar above a white timeline, instead of both being white.
I love Twitter. This version doesn't love me, or anyone else with vision difficulties. 
This needs to be addressed."
twitter,nz,6.38.1,1,This update is garbage... I don't get notifications for anything anymore and my timeline is messed up... I almost feel like not using this app anymore.
twitter,nz,6.37.2,5,üëç
twitter,nz,6.37,1,I've already unticked the tailor tweet so I won't have to see teeets from other people that follow my followers. I have to keep logging out to make sure i dont see the tweets on my phone. this is getting annoying and I'm sick of having to log in and out so I won't be able to see the suggested tweets from people I don't follow. Please fix this issue! it's really annoying having to always log out!
twitter,nz,6.36,4,Liked it a lot but sometimes get tired of the constant changes
twitter,nz,6.35.1,4,"Running mutiple accounts, its easy to flick between, post pics & links"
twitter,nz,6.34.2,1,"Twitter for iOS seems to be getting worse. The app constantly crashes whenever I try to browse Twitter for more than a few minutes, making it nearly unusable."
twitter,nz,6.33.1,4,"Great app! But I wish that the video option worked, when I go into my camera roll all my videos disappear. I am not the only person experiencing this, please fix this. - I am on an iPad."
twitter,nz,6.33.1,5,I just love it!  Since joining 4 months ago it's gratifying to know so many others share & respect my opinions.
twitter,nz,6.33,1,"Please fix the issue,, words sent with direct message not appears in the bubble,, but it is out of screen!!"

twitter,nz,6.31.7,2,"Some notifications. Like people who start following me. Won't clear in the app yet I get a badge app icon. I have to go online to view and clear.

twitter,nz,6.30,4,Still getting used to Twitter but it's a good app.... üòÉ
twitter,nz,6.30,5,love it
twitter,nz,6.29,5,The twitter is a great app that allows me to chat with my fans from my YouTube channel Trippin Gaming. Not only can I chat with them but they can stay up to date with what I'm doing and I can do that with the people I follow is well. I would highly recommend this app to anybody.
twitter,nz,6.28.1,5,10/10 yis dis is
twitter,nz,6.28.1,4,"Twitter is a cyber haiku
Twitter is a silent score
words paired back,space  pebble dropped into a pond"
twitter,nz,6.27,3,My timeline is clogged up with random stuff that I haven't even followed I think next update it should be an option to have that stuff on the timline
twitter,nz,6.27,3,"Sometimes I will get that annoying ""1"" that comes up and I will enter the app and have no notification. I will look through everything and refresh everything and no matter what I do, it will continue to have the ""1"". So I have to uninstall and reinstall the app to get it to go away."
twitter,nz,6.27,2,Pleaaasseeeeee!!! UPDATE!!!
twitter,nz,6.26.1,1,"There's been many new updates, but it's still missing some of the new useful stuff like group DMs, which I would be using frequently if this damn app had it. RIP iPad Twitter Updates"
twitter,nz,6.25.1,3,I just got a new update and I can't find the trends anymore??
twitter,nz,6.24.5,4,"Went a bit crazy a couple of weeks ago when photos wouldn't download, but generally pretty fast, accurate and doesn't crash."

twitter,nz,6.24.1,1,"this is my timeline lately. tweet tweet tweet promotion tweet tweet tweet promotion.....third party apps are a must alternatives as of right now. totally bizarre for an ""official app"""
twitter,nz,6.23.1,4,I use this app nearly every day but you need to fix this problem - I can't connect to the Twitter app using me cellular data!
twitter,nz,6.23.1,1,"Before I did the latest update I used to receive text notifications to let me know when someone I followed mentioned me, tagged me or sent me a DM, now I don't get them at all so I keep missing messages. Why did this happen, so annoying. I have been searching for a way to fix it but I'm not finding anything"
twitter,nz,6.23.1,3,"I love this app! However, there is one aspect that I don't like. I have an iPad and it's updated to the latest iOS but group dms don't work on my device. Why is that? Please fix this app so I can give it 5 stars! I really need group dms on here."

twitter,nz,6.20,5,Every time I go an open the lists I have created they are always left at the tweets form Hours and hours ago and I have to scroll all the way to the top to see the new tweets. Before the new update it never used to happen it always used to open at the top.
twitter,nz,6.20,5,Love twitter big time üòù I'd say I'm addicted to it lol

twitter,nz,6.18,5,Must be good if I'm doing a reviewüëç
twitter,nz,6.18,4,Overall a great app. A little frustrating to pull up Twitter and it doesn't start at my last read tweets and I have to scroll back.
twitter,nz,6.18,3,"It does what I need it to do, interaction and UI is pretty good too"
twitter,nz,6.18,2,"A very frustrating app! Would like to be able to pick up my iPad and start reading tweets from the place I was last at - frequently it goes to the latest tweets and I have to scroll back to where I left off.
Also if I get the message ""load more tweets"" it should push the later tweets upwards, so my position/time point doesn't change on screen. If I get the ""load more tweets"", I also have to scroll down to the place I was last at.
Also the app should remember the position/time point for each user, if I have multiple accounts."
twitter,nz,6.18,1,The latest update has again scrambled the order of tweets - making it difficult to read them in order.
twitter,nz,6.17,3,Need an easier way to delete multiple dm's?
twitter,nz,6.17,5,"The app is built well, a little glitchy at times but easy to use."
twitter,nz,6.17,5,Very exacting
twitter,nz,6.17,1,"Faster to use the website, really counter-intuitive."
twitter,nz,6.17,3,It's good but not as good as talking to people in reality as opposed to cyberspace.
twitter,nz,6.17,1,I have 2 notifications before i open the app. I go into the app and theres nothing new. Please fix this. Thanks
twitter,nz,6.17,5,I really love using Twitter but I always seem to see that I am getting 8 notifications but I check in the app and there is nothing ? But when I do get a notification it doesn't say 1 it starts from 9 going up ? I don't know where the other 8 are coming from and can't get rid of it. Please fix it üòä
twitter,nz,6.16.1,4,"This app is great for fangirling and all that stuff.. One thing that annoys me is that the notifications get in the way of sending a dm, replying to a tweet etc. it would be great if you fixed this üòä Thank you"
twitter,nz,6.16.1,1,"Doesn't even open up! Can't use the app anymore, something wrong with latest update"
twitter,nz,6.16.1,5,Choice app
twitter,nz,6.15.1,5,it's just is! lol
twitter,nz,6.15.1,2,I reinstall the app but twitter still loads one tweet at a time as i swipe up.
twitter,nz,6.15.1,5,This does exactly what it says it does. No more no less.
twitter,nz,6.15.1,1,I just downloaded and logged in and nothing is working. It says connected but I can't access any tweets or anything
twitter,nz,6.13.6,4,..
twitter,nz,6.13.6,2,"Since iOS 8 / Twitter app update, it's impossible to remove the badge app icon. Still not fixed in recent updates.

twitter,nz,6.13.6,4,I love keeping up with the gossip from my fave celebs but you should be able to upload videos like 30 seconds or something that would make twitter even better
twitter,nz,6.13.6,5,Can't complain!
twitter,nz,6.13.3,5,Ignore the negative feedback! It's great!
twitter,nz,6.13.3,3,Why can I no longer disable the badge app icon?!!! I hate those annoying red dots on my home screen.
twitter,nz,6.13.3,1,Since I updated the app has been unusable. Just the spinning wheel of death which seems to be a widespread issue.
twitter,nz,6.13.3,1,Send help please...
twitter,nz,6.13.3,1,the update is soo baaaddddddd
twitter,nz,6.13.3,2,Since IOS8 update will not load anything - the spinning dial of death. Have deleted and reinstalled but still the same. Argh

twitter,nz,6.12.1,1,"From being one of my favourite apps, Twitter is now bottom. I'd rate it zero but the system won't let me!  Since the latest update, the app no longer works on my iPad. So far Twitter hasn't responded to my concerns about this."
twitter,nz,6.12,5,Does what it says on the tin
twitter,nz,6.12,3,The worst thing about this update is the following icon which comes in the right below the text! I'm following people by mistake when I scroll the page !

twitter,nz,6.7,3,Every update since 2013 still hasn't fixed the unchecked notification bubble that reappears shortly after I've checked my twitter notifications.

twitter,gh,8.47.1,5,Twitter has been a friendly community since I joined some years back and I‚Äôd recommend it to anyone who isn‚Äôt part of this wonderful community. One little problem I have is the fact that some videos are only limited to a particular geographical jurisdiction and if you don‚Äôt fall within that jurisdiction then you cannot have access to such a video and I find this very unfortunate because the world currently is a global village due the internet so videos and other contents irrespective of the geographical origin should be available to other geographical jurisdictions.

twitter,gh,8.45,5,It‚Äôs very good.
twitter,gh,8.44.1,5,Twitter is just a perfect place to be üî•
twitter,gh,8.44.1,1,Great app but my fleets are always lagging
twitter,gh,8.44.1,5,"Twitter is sooo cool, but whenever I view a fleet I cannot close it."
twitter,gh,8.44.1,3,The retweet button should be restored to the former.It‚Äôs exhausting having to retweet.
twitter,gh,8.44.1,5,"Although they are some mishaps from time to time , it‚Äôs such a beautiful place to connect . Seems like everyone is around you , the banter and the chaos, the trolls it all make the experience worth it"
twitter,gh,8.44.1,1,I believe the addition of fleet to twitter features is a bit unnecessary. The fleet makes the time line look bulky and uncomfortable to view/scroll through for long. I enjoy twitter without the fleet. Twitter remains unique without fleet. Please do reconsider this update.
twitter,gh,8.44.1,1,Bring back the normal retweets button please
twitter,gh,8.44.1,3,Retweets are too complicated now!
twitter,gh,8.44.1,1,My VN and fleet features only work when I log out and log back in. It‚Äôs frustrating
twitter,gh,8.44.1,2,Video takes a longer time to load and it‚Äôs so bad
twitter,gh,8.44.1,5,I think the only problem is the number of wards that u can type

twitter,gh,8.44.1,5,Take the Fleet off!
twitter,gh,8.44.1,3,Fleets are unnecessary. And bring the old retweet option back. Stop making the app annoying!
twitter,gh,8.44.1,1,"Remove fleets, make retweets  easier"
twitter,gh,8.44,5,"It‚Äôs a cool app Buh their restrictions are too much... sometimes you don‚Äôt even know what rule you‚Äôve broken
They should state what you‚Äôve done before restricting"
twitter,gh,8.44,5,I have updated but fleets still not coming
twitter,gh,8.44,1,You suspend people for airing their views without option for one to defend himself. Y‚Äôall are worst that hitler himself and always claims one can appeal without the option for that. SMH
twitter,gh,8.44,5,Great App
twitter,gh,8.44,4,Please change the retweet back to normal
twitter,gh,8.44,5,"If not Twitter, where else?"
twitter,gh,8.44,4,"Everything is good out here. The only problem I have with this app is the fact that you can‚Äôt easily find someone who follows you or someone you follow, unless you keep scrolling till you do. 
I believe there should be something like a search space that can help you to easily locate that person you‚Äôre looking for."

twitter,gh,8.42,4,Retweeting has become overly difficult in the last update. Please work on bringing back the old way of retweeting as it was more convenient. Thanks
twitter,gh,8.42,5,The retweet with quote is making things difficult
twitter,gh,8.42,2,"I loved it until I couldn‚Äôt retweet tweets by my colleagues and had to quote them when I genuinely had nothing to say, bring back the retweet and it‚Äôs back to 5 star. Love the voice feature by the way that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs 2 stars. Do better soon, thank you"

twitter,gh,7.30,4,"Hey Twitter i have been thinking why don‚Äôt you bring an update where by verified accounts or ‚Äúcelebrities‚Äù get to thank or recognize their fans or followers on the particular day they followed them
The celebrity does not need to do much, all they can do is on the very day any individual followed them they will have a list of followers based on the day they followed them then the said celebrities can post on their Twitter pages thanking them or showing gratitude 
At least this would also bring the celebrities closer to their fans/followers more...just an opinion üòä"

Also, sometimes, when I‚Äôm chatting with someone in the DM, if I leave the DM area to increase brightness or If I close my phone, it closes by itself. It‚Äôs not supposed to close every time I leave the App. I‚Äôm supposed to be able to leave my DM opened, go to another app and when I come back, it‚Äôs supposed to still be open.

We must deplore this disgusting act of censorship aimed specifically and exclusively at conservative voices"

I was locked out and now unable to access my account, which is pretty ridiculous since I‚Äôm already in my 20s and have been using this app for almost a decade. I sent an email and I am doubtful that my email was even read as what was sent back to me was just the same form that they had sent earlier. This is very disappointing as I‚Äôve been an avid user for years, it‚Äôs really ridiculous how we‚Äôve all been using it for years and now you‚Äôre locking us out. There wasn‚Äôt even an age limit back then, I didn‚Äôt have to fake my age or anything, so why do I, and many others, have to suffer the consequences of your negligence? This is really awful and I hope that you guys will work on this, considering the increasing amount of reviews regarding this matter. All our connections with friends and family, lost just because of this."
twitter,sg,7.33.1,1,"Please solve this problem of twitter blocking and locking me out from my account. I set my birthday as 10 Oct 2004 and twitter locked me out. I understand I was 13 years old so I waited until my birthday to be over. However, after my birthday (which I was already 14 years old and twitter say I must be 13 years old and above to be able to use twitter) twitter still say I am underage. Please solve this ‚Äúage‚Äù problem because I have waited Long enough for my account to be able to use again and I cannot stand this problem anymore. ‚îª‚îÅ‚îªÔ∏µ‚ï∞(‚Äµ‚ñ°‚Ä≤)‚ïØÔ∏µ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª"
twitter,sg,7.33.1,1,The app kept crashing within seconds of opening it. Couldn‚Äôt use the app at all without it automatically closing by itself after a while. Tried uninstalling and then installing it again but the problem still occurs.
twitter,sg,7.32.1,1,Unable to load images in direct messages.
twitter,sg,7.32.1,4,Good
twitter,sg,7.32,2,"honestly twitter is great and all but we all have at some point made a social media account before we were 13, and lied about our age. however, even after you turn 13, and enter your age in, if you had created your account before you were 13, you would get locked out and your account would be suspended, with a 80% chance of not getting it back. it's honestly stupid because we're already 13+ yet they still lock your account because you made it before 13, which is rlly stupid. they say they'll do stuff about it but it has been months where this has been going around. would definitely want a fix."
twitter,sg,7.32,2,"the new update lags a lot, it takes quite awhile for a tweet to be tweeted out and my thread replies keep going missing !! please fix it :("
twitter,sg,7.31.2,4,"Well, it‚Äôs good in such a way that it allows people to post only words unlike Instagram. But the word limit can be quite frustrating though."
twitter,sg,7.31.2,1,"And I‚Äôm not talking about mine or because of the size of the picture. Whenever I click on someone else‚Äôs pictures, it‚Äôs all blurry. Never had this happened before"

twitter,sg,7.30,1,"I understand the features of locking people out of twitter is for the safety of the users. But however, I created before I was 13 year old but I'm already 20 now. My account has been locked for more than a week now even though I've already send a request to retrieve my account. Seriously many people fall victims of this, do something about it already. If there are too much, then remove this stupid feature already. It's not easy to build up an account overtime."
twitter,sg,7.30,4,"hello! i love twitter its great and fun but whenever my friends send picture thru dm, It doesnt load and i cant see it. Apparently it can be seen thru desktop version but not the app? pls fix"
twitter,sg,7.29.1,4,some accounts have no activity since 5-10 years ago and are clearly not going to be used any time again in the near future. these accounts are using @s that active users actually wants and it‚Äôs unfair to keep these inactive accounts when their @s could be used by an active user. twitter is currently suspending and restricting a lot of active accounts but what about these accounts?
twitter,sg,7.29.1,4,Had been receiving the same notification for 3-4 times. Please fix this problem soon!
twitter,sg,7.29.1,5,twitter is being a b****!!!!!!my account has been locked for 2 MONTHS AND I NEED THIS TO BE FIXED!
twitter,sg,7.28.2,4,"The notification keeps jump out for one post, 4/5 times for each notification.
Please check, thank you!! ‚ô•Ô∏è"
twitter,sg,7.28,4,"I‚Äôve been an avid Twitter user since 2009 and I was 17 at that time. My CA (we call them ‚ÄúClass Advisors‚Äù instead of teachers, professors in this campus, btw!) told us to create a Twitter account to keep up with current world affairs‚Äîboth local and foreign.

Fast forward to 2018, I am STILL using Twitter to connect with others from another country, have a conversation with one of my favorite artists through DM, post videos and photos and many more.

Thank you for increasing the character count to 240 characters. I personally think it was a smart decision!

A lot of users suggested that the future updates should feature an edit tweet function and I disagree. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs important. Like on Twitter, on this review I‚Äôm writing, I speak for myself‚Äîùë∞ don‚Äôt need an edit tweet function. Really. However, I would like to suggest a text format function (e.g. *ùêõùê®ùê•ùêù*, _ùëñùë°ùëéùëôùëñùëêùë†_, ~ùóåÃ∂ùóçÃ∂ùóãÃ∂ùóÇÃ∂ùóÑÃ∂ùñæÃ∂ùóçÃ∂ùóÅÃ∂ùóãÃ∂ùóàÃ∂ùóéÃ∂ùóÄÃ∂ùóÅ~ and ```ùöñùöòùöóùöòùöúùöôùöäùöåùöé```) for the next update. Perhaps you could start this feature with a handful of tweet active users around the world before you rollout to everyone to see how it goes. It will make a huge difference than, say, an edit tweet function.

Do consider my suggestion. Will rate you 5 stars if you do. Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing! You‚Äôre doing amazing! <3

sometimes i‚Äôve scrolled halfway through my feed and had to exit the app, but when i open it again it goes to the top. please fix this- i did not have this issue in the previous version."
twitter,sg,7.8,4,It would be great if you guys added a ‚Äòsave video‚Äô function since it‚Äôs really a hassle just to save videos from twitter. I‚Äôll have to copy the link and use an external source just to save it. So it‚Äôll really make a difference if that function is added.

i.e. When I open the app to search for particular content I often have to wait for up to a minute because of the amount of banner notifications.

I want to retain the notifications for people I follow, but I also want to be able to use the app immediately to search for content rapidly.

Please give us the option for notification banners to appear in the middle or at the bottom of the screen.

There should also be a way to turn trends for a certain category, i.e. sports
It‚Äôs quite annoying when you don‚Äôt follow sport of any kind and your trend timeline is basically nothing but."
twitter,ie,8.48,1,"I do not support Trump but I find it problematic that this app kicked off the president of the United States for ‚Äúincitement to violence‚Äù, while Chinese communist party are allowed to tweet whatever they like, for example a couple of days ago they tried to justify genocide against Uighurs. And crazy dictators like Ali Khamenei are also on this app. Twitter censors conservatism disproportionately compared to any other political ideology. Contender of Twitter was an app called Parler which was kicked off Apple, google play store, and also Amazon servers where it‚Äôs foundation lied resulting in its demeanour which is a monopoly tactic. Lawsuits will be coming Twitters way and big tech companies will be regulated more and dealt with. I am Irish, not American and have no bias in this whatsoever.

twitter,ie,8.48,5,Recently Twitter has been banning and suspended in the accounts of people they don‚Äôt agree with mostly conservatives. I wouldn‚Äôt be suprised if they take down this review. I would encourage you to delete your account as to not encourage this violation of the first amendment.
twitter,ie,8.48,1,Downloading this app is the start to the suffering that is Twitter jack Dorsey has tactfully chosen the kind of ‚Äúnews‚Äù he wants the masses to see the ‚Äúnews‚Äù that comes with the biggest pay check
twitter,ie,8.48,1,"Quite incredible the powers that twitter have invested in themselves , deeming themselves higher than any authority . Depravity is the word that comes to mind .

twitter,ie,8.48,1,Well made app however this is an extremist organisation who should be boycotted. Better to use Parler.
twitter,ie,8.48,1,Freedom of speech has gone on this platform so I will no longer will use it.

twitter,ie,8.48,1,"Login not working, always giving expired"
twitter,ie,8.48,1,"Fleets, topics, likes of people followed, replies of people followed, are all terrible and inconsistent. This would be fine except *they cannot be disabled*. Also, despite launching Twitter API v2 last year, they used out of date technologies and *still* block third parties from using several core features (presumably because the API is intended for other use cases and they don‚Äôt want third parties making Twitter clients). 

TLDR is the first party app is garbage and they specifically block third parties from creating better alternatives. Very disappointing. Tweetbot is a better experience despite its missing features."

twitter,ie,8.47.1,5,Twitter allows to much sledging and bitter comments. MM has algorithms for everything yet you can‚Äôt prevent on line toxicity. I don‚Äôt buy it. You‚Äôre not trying hard enough.

twitter,ie,8.44.1,1,"That was the worse idea ever to creat sth same as instagram but in twitter, just stop it."
twitter,ie,8.44.1,5,It‚Äôs a great app use it everyday I like it anyways
twitter,ie,8.44.1,1,"Mostly this is an okay app, but the adverts and suggested accounts ruin the experience. That, plus the new ‚Äústories‚Äù feature. These things should be optional, and I‚Äôd pay money to remove them. I‚Äôve paid for other Twitter apps in the past, but lack of push notifications in them is a deal breaker for me. So, I‚Äôd happily pay a small price for an ad-free, suggestion-free a story-free version of this app."
twitter,ie,8.44.1,1,"Honestly, I don‚Äôt see the need. I don‚Äôt like the new layout, it looks very cluttered, and not like Twitter at all. I just don‚Äôt like it. An edit option would be much more beneficial."

twitter,ie,8.44,1,"Pro far left joke of a social media tool, loved to censor anybody who  thinks differently or has different opinions, has no problem with crooked president elections and are happy to censure legitimate concerns regarding illegal dealings with Ukrainian criminals and meth heads sons of falsely elected presidents.

twitter,ie,8.25,1,News feed constantly refreshes as I scroll send the feed back up to where I have already read meaning I have to scroll all of the way through the same posts just to continue on reading new content. Please fix as it is VERY irritating.
twitter,ie,8.25,1,"My account was suspended 2 years ago and everytime i tried to appeal it, i got the same automated response so i made a new account which got suspended 2 days ago for ‚Äúevading suspension‚Äù . i don‚Äôt think this is fair at all. i tried to use my backup account, that got suspended, tried to make another new account and that immediately got suspended. i never did anything in the first place to get suspended and now i‚Äôm IP banned??? i use your app everyday and now to be told i‚Äôll never be able to use it again for no reason is very unfair."
twitter,ie,8.23,5,Very helpful app
twitter,ie,8.23,5,Hi. I‚Äôve been trying to access content on different twitter feeds that I follow and everyone I open it tells me that there is no content available. It has been working perfectly up till a week ago and it‚Äôs for the first time let me down. Could you look in to what the problem could be?
twitter,ie,8.23,2,An alright social media platform that gives ample space to nazis and extremists
twitter,ie,8.23,1,I have tweeted to prime minister of Ireland however can‚Äôt even see if they have read the comment or reply me.

twitter,ie,8.22,3,"Love Twitter, hate the way it is still refreshing. Also that I don‚Äôt see broad range of tweets from people I follow. I find that am being sucked into a deeper bubble.  Makes me want to stop using the app."
twitter,ie,8.21,5,"I feel this app isn‚Äôt designed to enable people to make a concise comment. There should be away to incorporate an app that helps the user with their grammar , syntax etc to make succinct comments."
twitter,ie,8.21,1,"This app ruins peoples mental health.

I keep opening it in hopes of finding uplifting content, leading only to immense disappointment.

If you download this app, you‚Äôll be met with droves of clown images, gen Z memes that are borderline psychotic, e-celeb drama, self-proclaimed ‚Äústans‚Äù of varying culturally relevant artists, and celebrity ‚Äúcancellations‚Äù (though the latter only seems to take effect for a short amount of time before the celebrity in question posts a half-assed apology and everyone in the hivemind forgets the events that led to their cancellation in the first place)

0/10 would not recommend"
twitter,ie,8.21,5,It‚Äôs the voice of the people.üòä

twitter,ie,8.20,5,"Twitter isn‚Äôt just a app, it‚Äôs a community and a very strong platform for interactive expression."

twitter,ie,8.19,4,Overall I like Twitter but learn to ignore the idiots.  Twitter needs to do more to highlight fake accounts.
twitter,ie,8.18,5,I never thought I‚Äôll admit I like Twitter. Brilliant communication app
twitter,ie,8.18,1,For some strange reason Twitter have decided to update the way replies are shown. It has ruined what was once a perfectly good app and turned it into an amateur looking mess.
twitter,ie,8.18,1,They won‚Äôt display the correct amount of #ObamaGate tweets. Placing it lower in Trending lists despite having much more tweets than any other.
twitter,ie,8.18,2,"If only Twitter could enforce one account per phone number and remove bots with no purpose or meant to just spread fake news, then it would be great, but we know Twitter loves fake news and misinformation."
twitter,ie,8.18,1,"I can‚Äôt tweet or like anything, so not so great!!"

twitter,ie,8.17.1,1,The app keeps on crashing every time I open it

twitter,ie,8.15,2,Took away my favourite feature. Under trends you had grouped themed tweets. They were often more interesting than‚Äôm my feed. It was why I checked twitter on my phone and not my laptop. Can you bring it back in next update?
twitter,ie,8.15,5,I was asked to review
twitter,ie,8.15,2,"So,it asked for my birthday I put it in and,it picked my account I don‚Äôt know why but please unlock it user is @aoifethepanda"

twitter,ie,8.14,2,"Twitter used be fun. It can draconian for regular punter but if you‚Äôre a racist or a corrupt leader, the rules do not apply to you. You are welcome to spread hate"
twitter,ie,8.14,5,I would recommend Twitter as it has all the news at your figure tips and also bring us photos of things in the Community

twitter,ie,8.10,1,"Ugly app that's  lacks editing  post  anti free speec, but over- hauled  by idiots!"
twitter,ie,8.10,1,Yes I must say this I think Twitter is a sister companion of RT√â..... more of them and less of  you. .... I think I will have to collect my thoughts & delete both.

twitter,ie,8.5.5,5,Building up a number  of the right Twitter contacts is the best way to grow a network and build a personal profile
twitter,ie,8.4.6,2,"The most recent update has placed the menu on the left side, for some bizarre reason. As a right-handed person, this makes it nigh-impossible to use with one hand. A solution would be to allow switching the menu to the other side in settings, or simply reverting the change."
twitter,ie,8.4.6,4,"The immediacy of the medium is seductive. It is The Spirit of The Age made manifest.

 That means it‚Äôs all the more important to pause before tweeting, and realize that when you do get into a confrontation, you should stand back and let the Twitter Team review it.

That‚Äôs what the Block and Report functions are for.

Thanks guys. Keep up the good work."

twitter,ie,8.3,5,Best app. Period.
twitter,ie,8.2.6,1,"The app size is almost 1GB now, to fix this I need to delete and reinstall it every week or so. That is the most idiotic thing ever. Deleting of cash is not helpful, it‚Äôs always like 32MB."
twitter,ie,8.2.6,5,I think Twitter is MIGHTY
twitter,ie,8.2,1,App is still ‚Äúrefreshing‚Äù while reading tweets after latest update to fix a similar problem
twitter,ie,8.2,2,Twitter is toxic. Is is a far far left leaning platform that censors any thoughts it does not agree with. It is no longer a speech platform but basically the same as any other media and it‚Äôs government protections should be removed as it is no longer run within its own guidelines
twitter,ie,8.2,2,"I can‚Äôt set up a account with Twitter,
Very bad app."

twitter,ie,8.1,1,"As I‚Äôm scrolling down through twitter, the app periodically resets to the top of my feed. Really annoying as I have to scroll down to where I was before."
twitter,ie,8.0,1,Tweeter is a fad a lot of fake news on it

I can interact with people who‚Äôs views are not in line with my own and it is very easy to get away from people who are threatening or hiding behind a nome de plume which is great. I find it is the only form of social media where I have full control over content.An interesting place to converse with people from all corners of the globe.

twitter,ie,7.48,5,Love it
twitter,ie,7.47,1,"Upon using twitter after the update, avatars for people and pictures do not load, this is not due to wifi as it always seems to happen, on mobile network in my house, in others houses. Please fix this."
twitter,ie,7.47,2,My DMs on my account have been broken for at least 2 months now. I have no one to contact and no way to fix it. Otherwise the app is good but I need this bug solved.
twitter,ie,7.47,1,No photos showing on iOS in the latest update...

twitter,ie,7.47,1,Cesspit for angry left wing sjw psycho keyboard warriors.
twitter,ie,7.46,1,Twitter has locked all my accounts and when I put in the verification code to unlock my account it keeps saying it‚Äôs incorrect. Won‚Äôt let me create a new account with my phone number still says verification code is wrong when I put it in.
twitter,ie,7.44.1,4,4 star because starting out is a little bit hard (as in the interface and GUI)
twitter,ie,7.44.1,4,"I have noticed while using spotlight search in iOS that certain twitter results are duplicating. If I do a search for ‚ÄúTom delonge‚Äù I see 2 twitter pages saying both are the official twitter page for this person I am only seeing this on certain twitter pages within spotlight search on iOS 

I have screenshots which I can send if needs be.  Apple have told me this is a bug on twitters end not apples end. If so please fix this annoying bug 

Thanks very much"

twitter,ie,7.41.2,5,Best social media app available in the store.
twitter,ie,7.41.2,5,"Twitter is the #1 social media, business and instant news media forum of this age.

Preferred choice of world leaders. At least that‚Äôs one thing they know how to get right.

Twitter gives individuals a groundbreaking possibility to talk to anyone through the world from The Pope, The US President and even landers on Mars. 

If you run any type of business or organisation, Twitter is a must have.

twitter,ie,7.41.2,5,Very good app you i like using it and does whatever it is supposed to do 5 stars for me
twitter,ie,7.40,4,Love Twitter but it‚Äôs lacking an edit button!
twitter,ie,7.40,3,They added a sort tweets by new option but it keeps reverting back :/
twitter,ie,7.40,5,"I love the quirkiness of Twitter, I know it is mainly about sports, sports and banal stuff.  But often  it‚Äôs real as it‚Äôs happening stuff. it‚Äôs where I get my news from. If I had more time I would spend more on periscope but too busy in real world."

Hope an update will be there soon."
twitter,ie,7.38.1,2,Needs Apple Watch support

twitter,ie,7.37.2,1,"Downloaded twitter today after having deleted it a few months ago. I logged in and haven‚Äôt even been able to use the app as it keeps giving me an error message when it asks me to review my current settings so no tweets are loading and the whole app is blank, can‚Äôt use it. This problem seems to be going on for a few days so why hasn‚Äôt it been resolved yet?"
twitter,ie,7.37.2,1,App keeps showing an error when I agree to new t‚Äôs &c‚Äôs. Now unusable üòî
twitter,ie,7.37.2,1,"I updated the app yesterday and now I can‚Äôt see any tweets or use any of the app features because I keep getting an error message once I try to agree to my current settings. I‚Äôve deleted the app and tried to download it again, however the problem persists."

twitter,ie,7.35,4,"Got rid of all MSM & rely on Twitter + some writer's websites instead. But the app is spoiled by an increasing sense that suspensions, banning & algorithm manipulation are being used to suit a misguided & biased supposedly 'progressive' agenda. Suspending honest journalists, however distasteful, while allowing & enabling vile jihadis, their Western backers & assorted war-mongers to promote violence & war is utterly unacceptable. Those I follow & myself are keeping an eye on non-US alternatives and may jump ship if this censorship continues."

twitter,ie,7.34,2,"I had Twitter a while ago but I deleted it. Now, I wanted to get it back but I‚Äôm not old enough so I had to get parental consent.

twitter,ie,7.34,1,App is meh kicked me out of my account for no reason refuse to delete and ban abusive accounts what if someone takes their life because they are fed up of the abuse twitter sees nothing wrong Twitters report abuse option is bollox all you get are bots if someone reports abuse listen to them and do a proper investigation accept screenshots of proof sort yourself twitter
twitter,ie,7.33.1,1,"Every time I go into the twitter app, my account loads up and it crashes I don‚Äôt like this, and Twitter is one of my favorite apps so please fix this!! Or I will delete this app üò™"
twitter,ie,7.32.1,4,"I love twitter. I really do. What I don't love is that every video I watch is almost always in the lowest quality possible.There's no quality adjustments to my knowledge, so that's why Twitter only has 4 stars. #qualityisquantity"

twitter,ie,7.28.2,3,"I use twitter almost all of the time, it is an easy way for me to keep up to date with friends and people I admire, but every time I create an account the site claims that I am underage. I am over the age required to use twitter, which is 13, having been fourteen for almost a full year, but it keeps saying I‚Äôm underage. I have went through 4 accounts because of this and I would appreciate if it stopped."

twitter,ie,7.26.1,1,"I‚Äôve had this twitter account for years and it‚Äôs locked me out twice in 1 week for no reason, I don‚Äôt share any hurtful things and the only way back into my account is to add my phone number. I‚Äôm quite uncomfortable adding my phone number but I tried to do it anyway cause I want my account back and then it says ‚Äúunsupported phone number‚Äù like seriously twitter??! Locked out for no reason??"
twitter,ie,7.26,1,"Twitter was fine until the latest update. Even on a brand new iPad, the delay in responding to touch is unacceptable. Please try to fix this."
twitter,ie,7.25,2,"I‚Äôve had a twitter account for over 6 years now and how never posted anything hurtful or violent etc but you suspended my account because of age restrictions after I just started to use my account again? If I was old enough six years ago you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd be old enough now.... I‚Äôm very annoyed, I don‚Äôt want to have to restart and make a new account because I like the posts etc I have on this one so I‚Äôd appreciate it if you sorted out this problem because I know I‚Äôm not the only person this is happening too. I don‚Äôt know why twitter is locking everyone out of there accounts. I used to love twitter but honestly I‚Äôm not impressed."
twitter,ie,7.25,5,"Twitter is so easy to use and lets me catch up on all of the latest news concerning people I admire to companies to even games and television shows! I really like this app, and I have a feeling you will too!"
twitter,ie,7.25,3,"Overall I enjoy Twitter for news and sport. But recently I have been getting more adverts which is a pain, and why do you keep repeating the same posts ?"
twitter,ie,7.25,1,"Surely no web platform is as hate-filled as Twitter. Not even Facebook is as bad, and that‚Äôs really saying something! It would appear that one can say anything at all to or about any other person and go unpunished with maybe the possibility of a temporary shutdown. Make every Twitter account identifiable and verifiable and then you might be onto something. Otherwise Twitter remains the hiding places of the worst kind of sniping, anonymous trolls. Twitter is either here to make a positive difference or here to make cash from the utterances of trolls. Come on Twitter: what‚Äôs it going to be?"
twitter,ie,7.24,1,Giving Twitter users only the options of 'agree and continue' or 'decline' under GDPR seems like very sharp practice and of questionable legality. Users should be presented with their opt-outs right there.

twitter,ie,7.23.2,4,"The app keeps popping up notifications when there‚Äôs no activity on my account. Every time I close the app, a numbered notation pops up."

twitter,ie,7.14,1,extremely slow since the update
twitter,ie,7.6,1,"Twitter was great I just wish it wouldn't filter tweets, drop followers and filter messages. Time to move to Gab."
twitter,ie,7.12,1,Recent update has stopped me from using the app as tweets never load.
twitter,ie,7.12,1,"Used to enjoy twitter and use it regularly but as time has went on,it has gotten progressively worse. Suggested tweets and ads have littered the app and made the overall experience less engaging. Hearing also about the new terms in the verification process absolutely baffles me and disgusts me. The higher ups have an agenda and even though claim they are against discrimination, discriminate against those who have different views that don‚Äôt fit the agenda. Would give it 0 stars if an option. Shame it has come to this"
twitter,ie,7.11,5,Just updated the app and it‚Äôs not working at all can‚Äôt post pictures up etc
twitter,ie,7.10,5,240 characters ? Bishop where
twitter,ie,7.10,3,The app keeps crashing when I try to make a photo or video full screen
twitter,ie,7.10,5,It's great üòÇ
twitter,ie,7.10,1,"The app keeps forcing things into the timeline which are not opt-out (or in for that matter). These are things like 'while you were away' or promoted ads or who you should follow etc. None of these things were asked for or wanted. None can be turned off. 

It‚Äôs impossible to spend time with this app without seeing unasked-for spam."
twitter,ie,7.10,5,The app crashes every time I open a photo or video. I'm on iPhone 7
twitter,ie,7.10,1,It won‚Äôt let me update
twitter,ie,7.9,1,"I had the old version of twitter, 6.8 or whatever it was with the 5 tabs along the bottom and the tweet and replies etc.. I accidentally deleted twitter and when I redownloaded it I had the knew 7.9 version even though I never said update. Very annoyed about it."

twitter,ie,7.9,1,Gets worse every update.
twitter,ie,7.8,3,I can‚Äôt see and use the app on my Apple Watch please fix it
twitter,ie,7.8,5,Era defining
twitter,ie,7.8,2,"I want to see tweets by time received and the current way is poor. 
Don‚Äôt like the promoted tweets, and the suggestions. Need to be able to change these."
twitter,ie,7.7.2,2,It won‚Äôt play videos embedded in retweets
twitter,ie,7.7,5,I love Twitter as I do tweet a lot and not just me tweeting a lot but the best place for breaking news of anything happens in the world
twitter,ie,7.6,5,Love being on twitter big thanks to all staff
twitter,ie,7.6,5,Recent update has changed the flow of the tweet feed. No longer easy to catch up on tweets from the day.
twitter,ie,7.6,5,It's good to know what celebrities and other people in the world are doing instantly by just looking at an app on your phone. I would definitely recommend TWITTER to other people
twitter,ie,7.6,1,"The new changes to the Terms of Sevice are unacceptable. I don't want my content to be published by news outlets without my permission or being paid for it. We deserve more than to allow our content to be used by The Sun to make money without us having a say in it. 
The new terms are ridiculous and should be reverted immediately."
twitter,ie,7.6,1,"Up until a few weeks ago this was my go to app for my Twitter timeline but since you can't turn off 'while you were away' any more, I can't use itso have changed to a different app."
twitter,ie,7.5.1,5,"Amazing, great for expressing yourself with saying anything out loudüëçüèªüòâ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÄ"

twitter,ie,7.4,5,"Twitter is a constant stream of News Updates, on the spot reports and mental stimulation on a worldwide variety of topics

twitter,ie,7.3.2,5,Great
twitter,ie,7.4,5,Such a good app üëç
twitter,ie,7.3.2,5,Twitter app is great as it updates regularly and keeps my privacy settings as I want them. I can block trolls and still see their posts and of course screenshots are great evidence.
twitter,ie,7.3.2,5,Really good
twitter,ie,7.3.2,1,"After this new update ,when I watch a video horizontally it has a large black rectangle at the bottom of the screen and makes it almost pointless to watch horizontally instead of portrait as there is no difference to sizeüëé"
twitter,ie,7.3.2,5,"Access to insights from the best and the brightest, without the noise of other social apps"
twitter,ie,7.3.2,5,"Great for keeping up to date, literally up to the second! And good fun too!"

twitter,ie,7.3,2,"Current version won't translate foreign language tweets and keeps cutting out on me, needs updating"
twitter,ie,7.3,3,"Do not like it , poor video upload and disjointed ."
twitter,ie,7.0,1,Chaotic timeline makes it unusable. Third party Twitter apps are the way to go.
twitter,ie,7.2.2,5,Love this app really keeps you up to date with celebs better than any other app to keep you up to dates with celeb goss and news
twitter,ie,7.1,5,"Very user-friendly, appreciate this latest version's updates."
twitter,ie,7.1,5,It does what it's supposed to - exactly what's required
twitter,ie,7.1,4,I'd prefer if the letter cap was increased
twitter,ie,7.1,1,"If I could give this zero stars I would. I hate the new update, not only is it hard to navigate but it was completely unnecessary. The old twitter was perfect just the way it was! Having your profile as a side bar is much too confusing. Please at least bring the profile button back to the bottom bar!! I love twitter but this new update is driving me crazy."
twitter,ie,7.1,4,Ad interruptions aside this app makes each day more interesting.
twitter,ie,7.0,5,I think Twitter should be compulsory.
twitter,ie,7.0,2,For about one year my follower requests says 1 but when I click into it it disappears. However when I get another request it will say 2 so I click into see the 2 requests but it's only the recent one that shows up. This needs to be fixed please üòî
twitter,ie,7.0,5,Love this platform.
twitter,ie,6.80,5,They asked me to rate so here I am
twitter,ie,6.80,5,"Someone came up on to direct messages sending a link to go to an instagram followers website.

twitter,ie,6.75.2,5,Love it.
twitter,ie,6.75.2,5,Good!
twitter,ie,6.75,1,"I basically hate all of the changes twitter have implemented over the last several years. None of them have been improvements. I loved the original twitter and will still use the platform, but all these updates are awful."
twitter,ie,6.71.1,5,Great app use it all the time!
twitter,ie,6.71.1,5,Great
twitter,ie,6.71.1,5,"Twitter is even more important these days for finding out what's happening and what people are saying and thinking- inspiring and shocking a way of making your world bigger and adding your moment, your fleeting thoughts or strong feelings"
twitter,ie,6.71.1,5,"I have photos on my phone that are from a canon camera and they're extremely HD brilliant quality but when I use them as a profile photo on Twitter they come out blurry, with pixels kind of. And it's not my wifi it's just Twitter, hope it can be fixed"

twitter,ie,6.69.1,5,Twitter ~ my very favourite Social Media application... Thank you Twitter and Founders
twitter,ie,6.69,3,Best social app ever! I deleted Facebook as I found it to be a waste of time. üáÆüá™ Twitter is constructive for terse dialogue with other users without the vanity project of Facebook or Instagram.
twitter,ie,6.68.1,5,All the same
twitter,ie,6.68.1,5,"Twitter is great app, easy to use & I use it many times a day for a number of accounts."

twitter,ie,6.64,4,"Love this native twitter app. 
Only criticism is the limitation it sets and no twit-longer option.
Otherwise- brilliant app."
twitter,ie,6.64,2,"I would have gladly given five stars as I spend the majority of my time on Twitter but the app is just getting ridiculous. For the last few months, it has lagged like crazy and I'm not the only one. Twitter Support has failed to even address the issue. My only option is to delete the app altogether."
twitter,ie,6.63.1,3,"Notifications is a bit buggy lately, I'm clearly getting tags and followers but they're not showing up in the notifications bar and I can't find them now. They pop up on the top of the screen then when I go to notifications it's not refreshing. It's not Internet as I tried refreshing on a 50mps wifi too."
twitter,ie,6.63.1,5,It's a great app
twitter,ie,6.63,1,This app won't update and I can't delete it either. Clicking on update on app store do nothing and I can't locate this app on a screen to delete it. No option to delete in app store either
twitter,ie,6.62.1,3,"Everyone is supposed to have the update for night mode but I don't have it and I asked ""@Support"" on twitter about it more than once and they continually ignore me."
twitter,ie,6.62.1,5,Great app
twitter,ie,6.62,3,After the update I cant get into the app. Otherwise a brilliant app!
twitter,ie,6.61,5,My lifeline. The first thing I do in the morning and last thing at night. Incredible access. Incredible news. Incredible Life. Become a part of people's lives. Chat. Listen.
twitter,ie,6.60,5,I find switching between accounts really easy with the app and using Twitter in general on the app is much handier
twitter,ie,6.60,1,This new update won't allow me to change my Twitter header which is very upsetting!! Each time I try to update it it tells me that it wasn't successful !! Please fix this asap
twitter,ie,6.60,1,"This upgrade is terrible it won't let me unfollow people , see my tweets and it keeps asking me to put my password in every minute . Deleting the app until it's fixed"
twitter,ie,6.60,3,"The previous update was completely fine for my iPhone 5, ran smoothly and I finally got the moments tab, but this update has added a delay for things like composing tweets, AND REMOVED THE MOMENTS TAB. DO NOT UPDATE IF YOU ARE ON AN IPHONE 5."
twitter,ie,6.59.3,4,Amazing app especially to get in touch with loved celebs. All though I wish for it to be updated to where you block people from seeing individual tweets..üôèüèªplease consider this
twitter,ie,6.59.3,5,AMAZING.
twitter,ie,6.58,5,"Good app. Works well on my phone and is quick to load even when internet signal isn't great. Fun, easy way to keep in touch with all the news."

twitter,ie,6.57,5,I never thought I would like Twitter but then boom. Love it üòÇ
twitter,ie,6.57,4,Gud but says every tweet it a day old even tho it was posted a second ago
twitter,ie,6.57,5,Never any issues. Fast and responsive. What you need from a social media app.
twitter,ie,6.56,2,"The new version of this app is a big disappointment it shows you tweets are that are a number of hours old and they keep repeating them throughout the day. Twitter has become very old like me, what are you doing with this app?"
twitter,ie,6.56,5,I like it it's up to date news and views just love it
twitter,ie,6.56,2,The new update keeps saying I have a notification and when I go into the app I don't have any and I close it and it comes back again
twitter,ie,6.55,4,"A lot more user friendly than desktop Twitter. Very easy to switch between accounts, a lot nicer than desktop's tweetdeck. Not a fan of the moments tab, or that you can't search indirects from private accounts. Also I'd like time stamps on my notifications."

twitter,ie,6.53.2,1,The app crashes down when trying to open it. Didn't work uninstall and reinstall. When will this be resolved?
twitter,ie,6.53.2,2,"It always says I have a notification when I'm not in the app and then when I go in I have no notifications? And when I do get a notification it doesn't even show up anymore, I have to check my email to see who retweets and follows."
twitter,ie,6.53.2,5,Best social media platform by a country mile

twitter,ke,8.47.1,1,"Twitter is a great app! However, they suspend accounts without letting you know the precise reason. In addition to this, after a while, the suspended account becomes locked. 

This is unfortunate especially because they don‚Äôt write to let you know if you‚Äôll recover your account or not, in spite of writing to them regularly! You‚Äôre left in a limbo, not knowing whether to wait for them to reach out to you or for you to start a fresh! 

From a concerned tweep!"

Prefer the previous version by far."
twitter,ke,4.3,3,"Why did they break an app that works? The worst ""new"" feature is the inability to jump to the top of the list by touching the top of the screen. Oh well"
twitter,ke,4.2,2,Please fix this app .b'coz I keep on getting notifications that isn't from my account at all
twitter,ke,3.3.1,1,I'm on a 3G using iOS version 4.2.1 and ever since the ''dickbar'' update the app just crashes constantly and almost instantly on startup so it's basically impossible to do anything! Before this update it was a great app...

twitter,za,8.52.1,5,"It‚Äôs a good app for updates and taking unnecessary topics to new Hights while the only thing it could be used for is unity and liberation. 

In short, if you wish to talk explicitly about intercourse and gain zero support in growing your business and talent, this is the app for you. So download me get ready to be ignored by people who use the oppressors language to seem far more intelligent than others, instead of understanding and helping each other. 
#Blackpeoplearenotracistenough."
twitter,za,8.52.1,1,People ain‚Äôt easily to follow you
twitter,za,8.52.1,1,It took Twitter 4 years to ban a hate monger like Trump and now algorithms are blocking the accounts of credible media sources in South Africa because they‚Äôre triggered by Bill Gates‚Äô name in article headlines. WTF.
twitter,za,8.52.1,1,There is this page using my pictures without my consent and I have reported the account but still no help from twitter
twitter,za,8.52.1,5,"Make it available for just one minute after the tweet is posted, thereafter you can lock the tweet for eternity. You know it makes sense"

twitter,za,8.50,1,I don‚Äôt have the Fleets feature. It appeared after I updated the app and then later on disappeared.
twitter,za,8.50,5,Twitter is a great app - what would make it even greater is having an edit button for posts when you‚Äôve made an error or typo

twitter,za,8.48,3,"I don‚Äôt know where they find some of these advertisers and why they choose to market them to me, but the algorithm is way off. Also, the ‚Äúin case you missed it‚Äù section of the app is constantly filling up my feed with things I‚Äôve already seen. Very frustrating and time consuming."
twitter,za,8.48,1,Keep myself updated was always great on Twitter but unfortunately I see a lot of Bias from the censorship of only certain people. You keep on terrorist and communist but you choose to block your own nations people. Not nice. Their your own people. Even if you don‚Äôt like them you can still tolerate one another in love and kindness.
twitter,za,8.48,1,Even before the 2020 elections in the U.S. this app has been shadow banning any and all accounts that didn‚Äôt follow their woke agenda. Twitter is nothing more than a dirty public toilet wall where sjw‚Äôs go to shout into the ether.
twitter,za,8.48,3,Why isn‚Äôt there a Twitter trend for certain countries?
twitter,za,8.48,5,Best social media platform to advertise your business

twitter,za,8.48,2,"On iOS 14.3

Everytime I play a video, then close it on (x) or simply swipping up, it continues playing in the background, only way to stop it is to pause then close. Unless this is a feature that needs to be disabled...it‚Äôs rather annoying."
twitter,za,8.48,1,"Dear Darlings of Twitter

Recently, I, aunty Pamela Shagwell Lee, got suspended from Twitter because of a supposed misdemeanor (breaking a rule). 

I asked for a reason and the same generic answers are given.

I would like for Twitter to explain to me in detail what I did wrong.

I am a foul mouthed momma to my little flock of LGBTQI+ children, a political critic and a free giver of insults (Donald Orange Trump)and an inspiration to stupid people like Ivanka. I stand for equality, truth and calling people out for what they are! Good or bad.

Now, Twitter, please answer me in detail. How did I break the rules again?

Kind regards
Aunty Pam"

twitter,za,8.48,5,"I have been a member of the twitter family for a while now and appreciate a lot of qualities that it has, but none more than it‚Äôs ability to be a social leveller & provider of a voice for the previously voiceless in all walks of life, particularly in the often forgotten rural villages of far flung countries.
As a global citizen & player, I have also been appreciative of how from previously travelling over 30 countries per annum pre-Covid, Twitter was one of the platforms that made my friends & colleagues always feel connected."
twitter,za,8.48,1,I‚Äôve got someone using my picture as her profile pic been trying to report her account for days now with no luck.
twitter,za,8.48,2,In the past I enjoyed Twitter and the freedom of speech. However now Twitter has a political agenda and double standards it just doesn‚Äôt seem fair play .

twitter,za,8.45,1,"I don‚Äôt get every tweet from people I follow, which forces me to go to each individual and make sure I get what they say.

editing/blocking/throttling anybody for any reason contravenes free speech and you need to stop that immediately, except in extreme cases which should be obvious.

I don‚Äôt like streams of posts showing me who other people follow. I‚Äôm only interested in which posts the people I follow ‚Äòlike‚Äô

Get that right and your platform will be amazing and the highlight of my day.

Continue to try to manipulate how people think, and show a complete disregard for people‚Äôs intelligence by you deciding what your users can read or watch is arrogance of the highest order and will be the death of your business 

Thank you

twitter,za,8.44.1,4,I don‚Äôt think the option to add a caption to a retweet is necessary. It would be nice just to retweet without the extra option of adding a caption.
twitter,za,8.44.1,1,"The fleets have made it awful. Every second post is an advert on my TL. It also an immense drain on very expensive data. The fact that replies to fleets are DMs is incredibly intrusive. Please do away with the fleets and far less adverts.

twitter,za,8.44.1,5,"Twitter is and will always be an amazing app. Adding the stories to Twitter is by far the most mainstream and basic app update that takes away from Twitters uniqueness. By adding the story feature it has made Twitter just like any other app therefore making it lose its originality. I know Twitter as a place for people to always speak on what‚Äôs happening... sharing pictures, videos, jokes and even news on the timeline. The combination of all of these things together with all the interactions that occur are what make Twitter amazing. Adding stories to Twitter was a terrible idea that now makes Twitter look like every other app. The layout with the stories is also quite unattractive. Please remove the story feature immediately. It ruins twitter‚Äôs image. I would have rated it 5 stars if the stories feature was not there."

twitter,za,8.22,5,Been back on the app since 2017 and now I‚Äôm hooked. I love the fact that this platform allows individuals to tell their story  and share it with many new people.

twitter,za,8.21,5,"How can you not have Twitter in 2020 
Just download it because you won‚Äôt regret it"
twitter,za,8.21,5,I will like to edit my tweet next time.
twitter,za,8.21,1,"Twitter‚Äôs app has an issue or two but for the most part it is a smooth experience. The truth is the reason not to download this app it‚Äôs that it will negatively affect your metal health and warp your perception of reality. Twitters basic design of a flood of messages, a like system added to the online culture the platform has developed has resulted in a system that is both addictive and encourages bad behaviour from its users. 

Your view of current events will become warped by toxic views and you will believe some ideas are far more popular than they really are. You will likely be personally attacked, old tweets may be used to ruin your life even if when you sent the tweet the comment was not considered controversial. 

You will lose faith in humanity and be consigned to either permanent rage or nihilistic indifference. Twitter will make you sadder more stressed and will likely encourage you to be cruel and aggressive to strangers. 

Uninstall this app or don‚Äôt download it. 

Believe me, you‚Äôll thank me."
twitter,za,8.21,2,We don‚Äôt want any update to Twitter other than an option to edit a tweet. Spelling errors and mistakes need to be corrected otherwise a tweet can be misconstrued. We don‚Äôt want anything from you besides the option to edit a tweet. Track changes if keeping the original tweet means so much to you.

twitter,za,8.19,5,"I give Twitter a 5 for up to date news, I trust Twitter. My addiction to the site is legendary. Keep the good work up!"
twitter,za,8.19,4,"Since the lockdown have been using Twitter for informative news in my country and the world about COVID-19. The bullying that is on this app it‚Äôs too much, there should be a department to sensor any bullying tweets. Close those accounts down please."
twitter,za,8.19,2,Love it but why do posts of accounts I don‚Äôt follow appear on my timeline?
twitter,za,8.19,3,"Like the title says. Twitter support = üëéüëéüëé

It's easy to report someone for going against Twitter's community guidelines, but they don't even follow their own. 

If an account is inactive for A DECADE it still stays up and no one can use that handle. 
Support staff are impossible to reach and if you do manage to get a hold of them they tell you that inactive accounts are ""normally taken down after 6 months of no activity"" but when I point out this particular account they just give me non answers to try and close the query."
twitter,za,8.19,5,"Twitter is the best app it keeps me busy in lockdown 
The best app so far"

twitter,za,8.18,3,"Would like twitter to have an editing option.

twitter,za,8.18,4,"okay i‚Äôm being dramatic. i love twitter. i really do. i use it everyday, but here‚Äôs the thing. i always receive the updates really late, and it appears that my twitter app is the only one that doesn‚Äôt have the worldwide trend option. all my mutuals do, and it doesn‚Äôt really make sense. i don‚Äôt want to keep seeing trends from the US. i‚Äôd rather see what‚Äôs going on around the whole world than in one set country. but yeah, good app !!"
twitter,za,8.18,1,"Being subjected to constant suspicions because I‚Äôm trying to increase my followers by following others. Lately Twitter blocks and suspends accounts not based on what you say, prejudice, offensive language etc but by following & unfollowing. Twitter ignores fake accounts that pretend to be certain people even after reporting them they‚Äôre still here spreading fake news."
twitter,za,8.18,4,"When I open the app each day, I would like to be able to the last tweet I read which should then open all the new feed which has come through. This should be done without me going through a series of ‚Äúsee new tweets‚Äù"

twitter,za,8.15,5,Please make the trending tweets easily available
twitter,za,8.15,5,"my twitter has been acting up for the last 4 days now, i cannot login nor view tweets. once i login it tells me, ‚Äútweets aren‚Äôt loading right now‚Äù !!"
twitter,za,8.14,4,That missing star is for the edit button that I sometimes wish for. We could maybe get 1 for every 10 tweets sent or something.
twitter,za,8.14,5,"On the search screen, under the Trends section, I used to have top stories in the categories of:
South African Politics 
South African Artists 
South African Influencers
South African Top news. 

All the above no longer display. It was easy for me to filter tweets according to my liking and preference.

I have updated Twitter twice, thinking it is a bug and the update will restore my Top Stories.

twitter,za,8.13,5,"I was locked out of my account for not meeting age requirements because my account was created before I turned 13. My account was created and run by my manager and hence my birthdate differed. When he was let off and i changed it, I was locked out and my memories...well good bye. Twitter really needs to reevaluate their regulations especially since their support team never does anything to actually help. At this point I‚Äôm extremely disappointed, a number of my fans are also disappointed and now...thanks to this stupid app, it‚Äôll have to be Facebook and Instagram all the way."

twitter,za,8.2.5,1,The latest update has totally ruined my trending section I absolutely hate the way it now is it doesn‚Äôt work for me. It no longer shows me local trends and influential trends in South Africa I‚Äôd be happy if you fixed that

twitter,za,8.2,1,"It hasn't been 30 days and I can't even retrieve my account,  I hate this app. It's only been 8 days, your technical support is useless. I only deactivated my account because I was writing about exams the same week. How the hell is my account gone when it has been only 8 days. I really hate this app now since nothing works at retrieving my account. My account got hacked"
twitter,za,8.2,5,"Despite its often raucous tone and the proliferation of all kinds of trolls, Twitter is a platform for people to hold forth on the issues of the moment. I have seen so many events unfold in realtime. Not a perfect medium but not to be ignored"

twitter,jm,8.52.1,5,I could never ask for a better app üò©üíØ‚ù§Ô∏è
twitter,jm,8.51,1,Twitter is too slack and is not friendly. Too much persons on this page with malicious and wicked intent are allowed to post other persons pictures up without there concern and spread malicious communication about them. When reported to twitter nothing is done by twitter.
twitter,jm,8.48,5,"I must commend Twitter for the way they have managed to ensure that nobody including the President of the United States spreads lies, propaganda and conspiracy theories on its platform."
twitter,jm,8.47.1,1,"Worst app ever..every time I created an account when ever I go back on the app it is telling me to create an account. And if u do have an account already and your tryna sign in, it tells you that the password or username didn‚Äôt match their records..."

twitter,jm,7.25,1,IT KEEPS LOCKING ME OUT OF MY ACCOUNT. ITS ANNOYING. I HAVE TO KEEP MAKING NEW ACCOUNTS AND EVERY ONE GETS LOCKED OR SUSPENDED. IM BEYOND ANNOYED WITH THIS STUPID APP. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT.
twitter,jm,7.21.2,5,Fast and efficient
twitter,jm,7.19,1,I just joined twitter today March 18 2018 and twitter as blocked me from my account already and I haven‚Äôt even used it. Then they said I should verify my account with a phone number. So because I live in Jamaica I type in my Jamaican phone number and twitter still would not let me in. So I proceeded to try a build a new account but this time entering my number first instead of my email. When I entered my Jamaican number it still did not verify so then I tried and American number and then it verified. I am extremely upset because twitter blocked my from my account and then doesn‚Äôt allow me to use an non American number although the option is provided it is of no use
twitter,jm,7.15,5,Hands down my favorite social media app for the past 8 years. Keep making me laugh
twitter,jm,7.15,5,It's just so entertaining. It's a good app to pass the time. And I just love it.

twitter,jm,6.73.2,3,"I've been using Twitter from 2010, so I know we've been coming from a really long way in regards to updates. One of the most annoying thing is that the 'favorite' got changed to 'like' so now it just looks as if we're copying 'Facebook' 
We also need AT LEAST 200 characters, I mean, we can only say such little in 140 üòÇ. 200 is not much, we don't want it to be like Facebook, but we're in NEED. The picture quality is another thing, you'd take a really nice picture with great quality and the minute you upload it, you're just contemplating on removing it because the quality sucks. Just a few things to think about üòä‚úåüèª"

twitter,jm,6.71.1,5,The twitter app is fabulous the only issue I have is that I can't quote someone's tweet and add something else to it. It can be done on other platforms tho and that I would love if you can change
twitter,jm,6.71.1,4,Twitter is a great app. It is constantly being updated. I have completely stopped using twitter clients. I love the night mode feature. Sometimes a bit clunky but works well for the most part.

I made a comment Facebook deleted it says it was Hate speech when it wasn‚Äôt 

I reported a page for bullying & harassing me

facebook,au,305.0,1,"Used to really like Facebook but now they seem to be trying to control what we can and can‚Äôt see around the world. Facebook is not the route of all knowledge and they should not have the power to say what is true and what is not. That is up to use as people to decide. Today they banned news outlets in Australia in a pandemic I might add. In a time where it is important to stay informed of hot spots and border restrictions is Australia. Maybe they don‚Äôt care about Australians safety during a pandemic. Or they just like the control. At this point I only have Facebook for market place. 1 star is too kind. 
Get your act together Facebook. Stop trying to control us. And endangering us in the process."
facebook,au,305.0,2,By this company that would remove access to professional and governmental news sources during a pandemic vaccine rollout.
facebook,au,305.0,1,"Banning news in Australia was a terrible business call, good luck"
facebook,au,305.0,1,"Facebook have really stuffed up here in OZ. They have blocked FB pages everywhere, even the weather bureau, charities, an official page searching for a missing child, a page with a foundation dedicated to an abducted/murdered child, a tribute page for a slaughtered family on the eve of the first anniversary, state govt health sites during this pandemic giving out essential news, a major airline, a major retailer, universities, hospitals, a state department fire and emergency page, a Kids cancer project, an MS page, a bowel cancer organisation, Save The Children Australia, Foodbank which feeds homeless people, the council to homeless people, several sports sites including Formula 1/AFLW, the NBA/Athletics Victoria, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, ACMI (Australian Council for the Moving Image), news outlets, the ABC which is our national emergency broadcaster during bushfires and weather events, Lifesaving Victoria, several domestic violence sites, 1800 Respect (sexual assault site)....if you ever wanted to piss off Aussies, then this was a brilliant move. We are really angry and several of us are switching. After 16 years, I want out."
facebook,au,305.0,1,"Facebook‚Äôs brazen attitude to Australian law and its disregard for Australian users have earned themselves this review. Rather than playing ball they have banned legitimate news site and left a cesspool of misinformation. They also have some insane ideas about what news is also banning public health, government weather and emergency services sites. Don‚Äôt bother worth the download."
facebook,au,305.0,1,it was handy when news content available on facebook but i don‚Äôt see them any more. i had to delete app which is not useful for now.
facebook,au,305.0,1,"Good bye Facebook. Massive privacy breaches and perpetuating fake news, disinformation and misinformation.  It could send us back to the dark ages , the same influence this company has on the world is scary . No accountability for their power . Shame . It could be used for so much good , and if it wasn‚Äôt all about money and money only ."
facebook,au,305.0,1,News has now been removed in Australia. I no longer support fb or will have an account.
facebook,au,305.0,1,The app is broken. There are no Australian news sources on the News Feed. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre gonna fix it. Maybe next version...
facebook,au,305.0,1,It was nice to wake up and find Facebook has decided to censor all new outlets in Australia but not only that they also block heaps of non news sites because they feel they are above the law
facebook,au,305.0,1,"The only reason I haven‚Äôt deactivated my account is because there are like two people who I care about who still is this awful, awful social media platform"

facebook,au,305.0,1,"Facebook has dogged Australians and got rid of Australian media from it. I will no longer be spending any money on advertising from my business, and I‚Äôve now deleted the app. Hopefully twitter likes the revenue."
facebook,au,305.0,1,Turning off access to helpful government pages because you don‚Äôt like the new laws being brought in. Petty
facebook,au,305.0,1,Facebook is a bully and full of rubbish.
facebook,au,305.0,1,Disappointed in facebooks actions to prevent news being shared in Australia including critical Covid and health news and weather report warnings - I will no longer be using this ‚Äòservice‚Äô
facebook,au,305.0,1,"Terrible, they blocked all news from the app. It‚Äôs where I came to get my news and now nothing, there 0 point in me using it anymore, as it‚Äôs not a social network, it‚Äôs a news site. Thanks for destroying Facebook with the really bad decision"
facebook,au,305.0,1,Hate what they‚Äôve done to Australia
facebook,au,305.0,1,Prevents sharing legitimate news content and emergency service information but allows propoganda videos to be promoted.
facebook,au,305.0,1,Thinking that they can just cut off Australians from  services that benefit and inform the entire country.  Every person who dies because of a natural disaster and didn‚Äôt have enough time to get away because they weren‚Äôt warned from media companies on the Facebook platform is now on your head.
facebook,au,305.0,1,Facebooks feed is now very boring. Users will find other services to use
facebook,au,305.0,1,Facebook will no longer show anything in regards to News in Australia due to it now having to pay news for its contents. A Billion dollar company will stop at nothing to make a profit.
facebook,au,305.0,1,Australia won‚Äôt be bullied
facebook,au,305.0,1,"Censoring speech, banning Australian news..."
facebook,au,305.0,5,"I do not care if you guys are money hungry or not at least the approach done most recently avoids stupid journalists publishing defaming information about people, or it at least minimises it."
facebook,au,305.0,1,"No more news means every second post on the feed is an ad. Yikes. 
Thankyou for the push Facebook I‚Äôve been meaning to delete this terrible app for a while now"
facebook,au,305.0,1,"As an Australian, today‚Äôs news blackout by Facebook shows how powerful and influential a corrupt company can become. Better to go elsewhere, Facebook has once again proven it has no integrity and will do anything to push back against its grubby money-making tactics, be it through tracking you or through childish ‚Äúfine don‚Äôt have any news‚Äù games."
facebook,au,305.0,1,Very disappointed in Facebooks handling of Australia. Shows their greed and disregard for democracy.
facebook,au,305.0,1,"Facebooks actions to ban news in Australia due to their greed is sickening. Blocking pages such as kids cancer Australia, and science and charity pages etc is horrible as well as blocking out news during a vaccine rollout is purely disgusting"
facebook,au,305.0,1,"Blocking official government Heath pages mere days before the vaccine rollout is absolutely destructive and negligent. Who‚Äôs running Facebook, humans or bots?"
facebook,au,305.0,1,"With the removal of News Pages in Australia, FaceBook has also removed MANY hospital, Heath, Emergency Services and Not For Profit pages. What a blow to Australians and these Community Organizations."
facebook,au,305.0,1,The app is very bad in general but i guess it‚Äôs only a small company. They need time and to learn how to make proper application and website. Still wait for the dark mode tho
facebook,au,305.0,1,"With the recent ban on Aust news, FB now peddles in promoting fake news."
facebook,au,305.0,1,In the midst of a pandemic Facebook has chosen to block access to vital Australian health information. Health services are collateral damage in a misguided attempt to influence negotiations over news content in Australia.
facebook,au,305.0,1,Bring back the news for Australia. That was half the reason why i liked this app
facebook,au,305.0,1,"Whilst Facebook has declined over many years, favouring to increasingly spam users with ads on their feeds instead of prioritising posts from your friends, their move today to ban all Australian news (and most ridiculously the South Australian & Queensland health feeds - during a pandemic!) was the last straw. Uninstalling the app."
facebook,au,305.0,1,"Facebook has restricted Australian Government Health Departments pages in the middle of a pandemic because of a dispute they are having over legislation that doesn‚Äôt exist yet. Irresponsible, and downright dangerous. They have also restricted the Government Meteorology page in the middle of Cyclone season. All because they have issues with an attempt by our Government to introduce legislation."
facebook,au,305.0,1,Gross. Stop it.
facebook,au,305.0,1,Absolutely terrible form from Facebook restricting the Australian public from accessing vital and important news and latest information. Not only from the news but city council pages and even the BoM
facebook,au,305.0,1,"Facebook move in Australia makes it useless to be kept up to date with relevant and reliable news.  

Facebook wants to rule the world."
facebook,au,305.0,1,"We are in the middle of a pandemic, I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt need me to tell you that, but apparently Facebook needs me to tell them that, because it has shut down not just all of our news pages on Facebook, but also the State health pages, which are used to update people on community tracing, domestic violence pages, which are used to save people‚Äòs lives, and other charity pages. This is disgusting, and horrifying. I have never felt so powerless"
facebook,au,305.0,1,"Blocking all news, even bureau of meteorology, because mark is too stingy to pay up. Grubs."
facebook,au,305.0,1,"Can‚Äôt get the news, so it‚Äôs all just... conspiracies!?"
facebook,au,305.0,1,"It is impossible to use this app. When messaging someone using an iPad, the keyboard covers the input area so you can‚Äôt see what your typing, and you can‚Äôt paste anything as the keyboard covers the input section no matter which way you turn your iPad it is completely unusable. 1 star"
facebook,au,305.0,1,"Facebook is playing childish games in banning the sharing of news. Australians rely on Facebook for COVID updates, bushfire alerts and weather warnings. That avenue of information sharing is now gone. Facebook has put Australians‚Äô lives at risk. Now all you get is misinformation."
facebook,au,305.0,1,"By far the worst of the ‚Äòsocial media‚Äô FB is a cesspool of conspiracy nuts, false profiles from non-democratic nations, and hateful trolls. Delete the app, jail Zuck."
facebook,au,305.0,1,Marketplace still crashes on my ipad. USELESS still.
facebook,au,305.0,1,Facebook has removed the ability to share crucial pandemic news and is actively deleting any post that come from credible news sources.
facebook,au,305.0,1,Facebook just banned Australian news because they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right. The majority of my feed was from news publishers so there isn‚Äôt really any point in me keeping the app
facebook,au,305.0,1,Facebook has blocked access to all news content and articles in Australia in the middle of a worldwide pandemic. Facebook cannot be trusted with anything.
facebook,au,305.0,2,"I‚Äôm not sure how FB managed upgrades, but ever since recent update I can no longer select albums to find photos when adding a photo on a response to a post. It‚Äôs yet another example where useful (dare I say necessary) function just disappears during upgrades. Having to search through 5,000 photos is crazy now!  Surely in a professional world wide app there are functionality tests on introduced updates to ensure they haven‚Äôt broken something!"

facebook,au,305.0,1,"Nothing gets updated, it just gets even more worse. Currently one issue is whenever you share from marketplace your item to a group it‚Äôs blank!!! 

Very disappointing fb cannot get this right being a tech company all these small issues."
facebook,au,305.0,1,Facebook needs to stop giving out your information or selling it to others
facebook,au,305.0,2,"Can‚Äôt scroll through a marketplace item‚Äôs photos in full-screen. Can‚Äôt zoom in for photos in marketplace either. Both of these features used to work, but have stopped?!"
facebook,au,305.0,1,"I‚Äôve contacted support multiple times and heard nothing. I‚Äôve been unable to use the Facebook or messenger app to log in for months now! It just keeps saying unexpected error occurred please try logging in again. I‚Äôve tried changing my passwords, I‚Äôve tried creating a new account through the app and it says it can‚Äôt be processed. Nothing is working however if I got to safari and log in it‚Äôs fine. So annoyed just want it fixed"
facebook,au,305.0,1,Your app is broken it will not log in i have attempted every thing to rectify this and nothing at all actually works...
facebook,au,305.0,2,"The general function of the app is ok but still has a lot of minor issues that get increasingly frustrated.

Firstly, the inability to actually get to a response on my comment straight from the notification is inherently stupid.

Second, the community guidelines are severely inconsistent. I literally saw someone make threats to someone and I responded to them, then noticed my account was suspended? Ok, well it‚Äôs been good to see them continue to harass people while I can‚Äôt post anything for one swear word. They definitely need to adjust there rules to at least allow swearing.

Thirdly, you use to be able to create events in the messenger counterpart app but it just doesn‚Äôt appear anymore.

Also a lot of weird refreshes that result in me losing a post I was reading or watching.

Hope to see some sort of improvement or adding back old features."
facebook,au,305.0,5,I'm wondering why we have to sit through ads while watching videos. It's one of the worst things ever on FB. It'd be great if you could get rid of it. Cheers

facebook,au,305.0,1,I only use Facebook because my family from overseas are on there. App randomly switches from dark mode to light mode with no way to change it back. Half of my feed is just ads and what they want me to see. So over it....
facebook,au,305.0,1,"Facebook has degenerated into the effluent of the social media world.  The extreme left-wing bias is repugnant.  It stinks and many are asking for a courtesy flush.

Case example: I used colourful language, along with the original image of a photoshopped version (which the person I was replying to was using to make a libellous inference of a high profile person), Facebook gave me a 24 hour ban.  

Fast forward about two weeks, and now I‚Äôm on the receiving end of some colourful language.  

Since I, and most conservatives, have something called a hide (read: not sensitive to verbal attacks) I was ok with it as I respect other people‚Äôs opinions, yet for the sake of experiment, I reported the comment.  

Approximately half an hour later, I received a notification that my report had been reviewed, and the comment (and I quote) ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt go against any of our community standards‚Äù.

I have screenshots of both cases and they are almost identical in content.

The only difference is the political side.

Facebook are muting and gagging any and all conservative views and promoting their own.

Facebook has become the effluent of the social media world and should be disposed of as such.  Along with their entire board.

And they will, in good time ..."

facebook,au,303.0,1,"Facebook doesn‚Äôt care about its users. It cares about the Ad revenue it gets. I miss the old days where you can talk about buying a house, car or other product and not be bombarded with ads on Facebook where they are tracking and listening in."

facebook,au,303.0,1,This app is terrible. Simply cannot log in at all tried multiple times and always comes up LOG IN ERROR. Zero support - there are no  numbers or email address to contact. A terrible app for such a large company. I‚Äôm going elsewhere
facebook,au,303.0,1,"Wish I could give zero star for This App..

facebook,au,303.0,1,"Forget this app. Broken, bloated junk that has absolutely no advantage over just visiting fb via browser. There is no need for this app other than tracking."

facebook,au,303.0,1,"Useless to me. Impossible to log in even when I‚Äôve entered a new password. Even worse, I can‚Äôt see how to delete FaceBook from my iPad. A lot of rubbish about assigning a nickname. I don‚Äôt want a nickname I just want to get rid of your program."

facebook,au,302.1,1,What is wrong with facebook??? I haven‚Äôt been able to login to my Facebook account through the app for weeks now! Every time I try it says error occurred try again later. Are you guys gonna do something about it please?
facebook,au,302.1,1,"Facebook keeps on locking me out of my account and asking for ID to be uploaded. When I upload it, Facebook sends me an email saying it‚Äôs unlocked and when I tried to login again using the link they give me, it says the account is locked and ask me to repeat the process. I‚Äôve done this 6-7 times, contacted Facebook numerous times and to this date it‚Äôs still not resolved and I‚Äôm still locked out!!"
facebook,au,302.1,1,Closed my account without even giving me a reason. Facebook communist scum are on their last legs anyway. Found my way to a better platform now where I can speak truth. And no I don‚Äôt abuse anyone or swear. Facebook just don‚Äôt like anyone going against their evil death cult agenda. BTW Facebook was invented by DARPA not Zuckerberg.

facebook,au,302.1,1,FB has made it difficult to make your own settings. It makes a blanket setting about who you see etc without consulting you. It makes LOTS of decisions without asking you. Why can‚Äôt I see my friends list without going through a contortionist routine???
facebook,au,302.1,1,Taken the video watch button away so can‚Äôt scroll through videos. No point using it anymore
facebook,au,302.1,1,Being censored is so wrong... you can not control us all
facebook,au,302.1,1,Manipulation of media is rife on fb now. Deleted
facebook,au,302.1,1,"So community standards between countries is different. Thats really poor form. I mean, you post a pic of a female nipple. Banned.

facebook,au,302.1,1,"My account got restricted with:
- no notification
- no indication of time span
- no way to appeal 
- no indication of *what* I did wrong. 

The last of which is what gets me the most because how am I supposed to rectify any violations? 

Furthermore when researching this not only have a found numerous accounts of the same thing, but also accounts of your ‚Äúblock bots‚Äù ie. Your poorly made ID banning people in regard to their pets flagged as illegal content. 

The introduction of these AI trying to make the platform more safe has made it a nuisance for anyone to use. I use Facebook for various support groups and I can‚Äôt ask for help, and I don‚Äôt even know WHY I‚Äôm not allowed to. 

Also, your app crashes a bunch. Finding anything in settings is like going through a maze, and because there‚Äôs no chronological feature I find I see the same posts over, and over. God forbid anyone post anything without a picture, I‚Äôll never see it."

facebook,au,302.1,1,Since I downloaded both the new updates for Messenger & Facebook when I click the marketplace tab on a conversation with ‚Äúsee details‚Äù it takes me to a new weblink to login to Facebook. It also encourages me to download the Facebook app instead. Which clearly I have done. This has never been an issue previously and is incredibly painful when you use marketplace regularly and communicate with buyers/sellers on messenger. Extremely frustrating!!!!
facebook,au,302.1,1,I can‚Äôt log on to my Facebook I haven‚Äôt had to log on in many years I‚Äôve forgot my password this is your mistake and I want it fixed ASAP or I delete Facebook

facebook,au,301.0,1,"Facebook will likely never read this review, nor do anything about the issues if they did...but here I go anyway.

The iPadOS version of this app is the poor cousin to the IOS app no their newly refreshed website. Not only are features missing, but more infuriatingly, the notifications engine is poorly implemented. On the iPhone and the website, if a notification says someone has commented on a post (thread) you're following, tapping that notification will take you to the post. However, in the iPadOS version, a tap will take you to the group the post was in, but you have to guess which thread it was. All I request is that Facebook make the iPadOS version of the app just as good at the iPhone app and website - nothing more!"
facebook,au,301.0,1,"Some people are free to bully, harass, belittle, spread false information and use others photos without consent (these people are not having comments or said photos removed and are not getting restricted)
On the other hand some people are getting comments removed and restricted for standing up against bullying, against sexist behaviour and giving actual facts (how dose informing someone about the rules and registrations of heritage plates for older vehicles = bullying and harassment and getting restricted for 7 days?)
Facebook is getting worse by the day, apparently you can only have a second account if you support a global socialist system."
facebook,au,301.0,1,"This apps still crashes my iPad when using Marketplace after a year of useless updates. Do the Facebook devs actually use and validate the app?

facebook,au,301.0,1,"Facebook has been on the ride for more than a decade now. It has reached the point that not only has limitless data for every user but it's using it to manipulate essential aspects of our lives.

Timeline? They show you what they want based on what draws your attention (yes their algorithm knows what you like and what not) 

News? Same same

Pages? They can and will allow only what is 
‚Äùallowed‚Äù and not what people are genuinely want to express them.

Facebook serves a purpose and is NOT there to ‚Äúhelp you connect‚Äù with your family."
facebook,au,301.0,1,the more they change features the more it looks ugly and so inconvenient.

facebook,au,301.0,1,"An absolute disgrace. Before Covid, before the dodgy elections, before forced vaccination, there were no such thing as a fact check.

That doesn‚Äôt even make sense."
facebook,au,300.0,1,"Facebook is an invasive data collection social media app. I used the app for years as a one stop shop for news, communications and shopping for second hand goods.

What a great business model.  You know your user want to desert you, so you obliterate the alternative. 
Zuckerberg, your day will come and the sooner the better for democracy."
facebook,au,300.0,1,"It would be great if Facebook left fact checking alone as it has no authority or power to determine if articles posted are correct or not. If it is based on documented evidence then you need to leave it alone, Fb. This is censorship. We are already bombarded and targeted  with biased articles and ads from you and your paid sponsors, so just keep it to sharing of information and personal communication, the way you said it was originally intended. Stop manipulating us ! We will not stand for it."
facebook,au,300.0,1,Facebooks censorship is a farce. They hire companies to do ‚Äúfact checking‚Äù and the companies write their own pages to create sources. Zuckerberg belongs in jail with the rest of his chronies

facebook,us,306.0,1,"So tired of getting phantom notifications for my business page, and yet no notifications when my business receives a message. 
Also, for buy/sell groups, I don't understand why sold items don't auto delete after a set amount of time, like maybe a week. In the group I admin, we keep asking people to delete instead of marking as sold, but it does no good. The option to mark as sold is just easier for them, but then the posts are still there. Even an option for admin to delete all posts older than a month old or something like that would work great. When people search for something, old posts from years ago all come up. I don't understand the point of this. Also, when content is removed by Facebook, we as admins would like to know what was removed so that we can take proper action. Notifying us that it was removed, but not letting us see what it was is the opposite of helpful."

This app spies on you way too much, they track your every move even if you make a new account and try to hide ads they still harass you with ads, and they block you for almost anything that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúlollipops and rainbows‚Äù. They invade your privacy , they take away your freedom of speech which is a violation of our rights in America. They don‚Äôt let you play music in your background on any type of videos, they will mute your whole entire video even if you have the rights to use the music as your own. This app is absolutely ridiculous. They pretend to care but this app and the people who run this app really don‚Äôt care about the people who use this app. I‚Äôve been using Facebook since 2010 and now in 2021 it‚Äôs truly not the same anymore.

YOU DON‚ÄôT EVEN DESERVE 1 STAR! If apple had the option to, I would give you 0.1 stars! 

Now, the reason I‚Äôm writing this:

Congresswoman Marie Newman made a post putting up a Trans flag outside of her office.

What did you do?

You took down that post, saying that  it contains ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù and could be ‚Äúinferior to some groups‚Äù.

Meanwhile, Marjorie Taylor Green has set up a plaque outside her office, saying: 

‚ÄúThere are 2 genders: Male & Female. [Believe?] the science‚Äù 

That post (and that plaque) are disrespectful to me as a genderqueer and ALL of my trans, non-binary, Intersex, bigender, genderfluid, etc... brothers and sisters. 

That post is still up. 

So you‚Äôre telling me, that supporting an approximate 800-900 MILLION people is ‚Äúinferior to some people‚Äù, but being against us (the same 800-900m people) is not?

facebook,us,306.0,1,"Facebook has the worst customer support I‚Äôve ever come across. I‚Äôve heard many people claim the same but personally never had an issue that needed support until recently. I began using marketplace for the first time. I decided to list a few items, one of which I decided to list because I had seen others list the same item. Somehow this became an issue and I got banned from marketplace for violating their rules. Facebook didn‚Äôt even tell me which rule I supposedly violated and didn‚Äôt even warn me. I opened an appeal case to reinstate me and the case was open for a day then closed. However, Facebook never got back to me and didn‚Äôt even notify me that they had decided to close me case. Horrible customer support and no real person to actually get through to."

facebook,us,306.0,1,Not getting any notifications at all on my iPhone from Facebook at all no live notifications if somebody tagged me no notifications on my phone at all please fix problems
facebook,us,306.0,1,First of all I had to come up with several accounts because the fact checkers and the Facebook police single out the conservatives and just let the liberal say whatever they want to. And by doing so I cannot remember the password to the account that I am using now and Facebook is absolutely worthless in trying to get me back onto my account there‚Äôs no place you can go to get information or to get help except their help and support site but you have to be signed in.  These so-called sixes have only made matters worse when it comes to Facebook and it was bad enough to begin with

facebook,us,306.0,1,"The last update was beyond horrible and now posts can‚Äôt even be deleted from the groups I admin. Facebook is getting worse day by day!!! Censorship is absurd amongst everything else that‚Äôs wrong with Facebook and it‚Äôs not even worth the aggravation anymore. Zuck is a clown and his priorities are clearly way off from the normal people in this worlds priorities!!! I‚Äôm so sick of the one sided politics with Facebook!!!! ü§¨

*** Update... So today Facebook finally fixed one of the numerous problems but unfortunately it only lasted a few hours so here we go again!!! I don‚Äôt think, in good faith, that I will ever be able to give a Facebook review with more than one star (one star is being very generous). Either they have no desire to fix the problems or they simply aren‚Äôt competent enough to do so. When Facebook tanks Zuck has no one to blame but himself!!!!"
facebook,us,306.0,1,"I went with no Facebook on my phone for almost a year but then needed access to it while fixing an investment property with no WiFi (mainly for selling crap). It‚Äôs amazing how Facebook continues to make the app worse with each update tho not surprising since their main objective is to data mine and keep up useless activity. 

80% of my battery life was used by Facebook over the last two months, despite being about 15% of my usage (and yes I close it often and have no backup refresh on etc)"
facebook,us,306.0,1,"Facebook got one star for me because I couldn‚Äôt give it zero. In the last year Facebook has decided that it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs mom and dad and it‚Äôs going to ban anyone who throws any comment they don‚Äôt like for 30 days at a time. They sell your information they dig through your phone when you install it on your phone or your PC they just a pack of Nazis who expect everyone to follow their standards except them. Go to Instagram or TickTock, Facebook isn‚Äôt worth your time or losing your data to."
facebook,us,306.0,1,"Facebook doesn‚Äôt allow you to speak your mind anymore unless you follow a liberal standpoint. What‚Äôs worse is receiving a 60 day ban a first offense over something that was shared more than four years ago that you found on facebook originally. This double standard crap is getting extremely out of hand. I‚Äôd highly recommend a different site, one where you can voice your opinion and not be silenced by it. Maybe they should bring back MySpace and dump this crap."

And I still get the message that avatars aren‚Äôt available in my area, even though it‚Äôs available to my next door neighbor.  3 years later and I‚Äôm still mad about not being able to create interest lists and have access to friend lists on the app.

Edit 10/24/20:  Since the latest update the back button no longer works, so if I click on a post I have to reload the home page when I finish reading it.  Still don‚Äôt have the ability to customize the newsfeed.  Getting worse with each update.

Edit 3/24/18:  Another update and still no access to friend lists.  Why have the feature if we can‚Äôt use it?  What exactly has been updated?

Edit:  Another update and nothing has changed.  Still can‚Äôt access friend lists!  The only choices for viewing your newsfeed are most recent or whatever Facebook chooses to show you.  If any developer is reading this - we want control of our newsfeeds!  Stop limiting how we can customize it!

This app gets worse with each update.  First they took away interest lists, which were great for organizing your newsfeed and being able to keep up with certain pages.  With the last update I can no longer see my friend lists (which I started using after the interest lists went away).  I don‚Äôt want to see posts from every page and every friend all the time!

facebook,us,306.0,2,Please fix the bug.
facebook,us,306.0,1,Facebook used to be a place to go to connect with friends and family. Now they fact check everything you do if it isn‚Äôt within their opinions. They have become a social media full of Billy‚Äôs for not having the same opinion as them. They have become a straight out of the Chinese Communist Party group that censores you and takes away your freedom of speech. I do not recommend Facebook!
facebook,us,306.0,1,"What the heck has happened to this once serviceable app? Seems it‚Äôs now run by people  with their own agenda. Anything that doesn‚Äôt fit their liberal narrative is promptly removed. It locks up, locks out, picks and chooses what I get to see, etc. and enough with the idiotic bi-monthly updates! It‚Äôs constantly being updated for no apparent reason other than to shove more useless advertising in our faces and make it harder to see ALL comments from whoever Facebook deems I should be able to see. The default is set to ‚Äúrelevant‚Äù - I should get to decide what I deem relevant - NOT Facebook police - and yet I cannot change my settings to ALL; I have to constantly change it for every single post.  Ridiculous! Last time I checked, this was the United States, where freedom and free speech are fundamental, underlying principles. We should be able to make our own choices as to what we see and read. Most of us are adults and can handle trolls. And all of a sudden, we have to dig up our stupid passwords just to get into the site. I was on this morning with no problem. Now I need to dig up my password. Aggravating."
facebook,us,306.0,1,Can‚Äôt even make a harmless joke to my friends without getting my account locked for ‚Äòmaking threats of bodily harm‚Äô. Can‚Äôt do anything on this website/app and it is very buggy to boot!! Facebook really has gone downhill.

And if I lose my account I‚Äôm fine with that because this just proves my point that FaceBook along with Twitter and Instagram just to name a few with not censor hate speech they censor speech they hate

facebook,us,306.0,1,Looking back to the beginning when things were great and only for college students to current day. Facebook had tremendously changed and is all about political agendas and censorship. I‚Äôve been put on Facebook jail numerous times for nothing at all. I report comments and nothing ever happens.

I tried logging into the browser, and it logged in just fine! My friend tried then to login to the app on my iPhone and her login threw the same codes. I was also able to login to her app on her phone, so I‚Äôm guessing the issue is specifically the app on my phone; I have tried several methods of uninstalling and reinstalling both the apps and restarting my phone, clearing caches, clearing browser history even and passwords associated in a last ditch effort. I‚Äôve likewise contacted Facebook through their help center several times with screenshots- is anyone else experiencing this issue???"
facebook,us,306.0,1,Facebook used to be a place we could go and chill and enjoy scrolling through your feed. Now it‚Äôs crappy ad after crappy ad! Even when you click never see again they put up another one it can even be the same just a different name! Because of this I‚Äôm finding another platform to go on. I despise Facebook now corporate at it‚Äôs finest! Also Facebook supports white supremacy and doesn‚Äôt think it goes beyond there community standards. Facebook is garbage. I literally repot an account that says cyber bully account that‚Äôs fake and they ignore it.

facebook,us,306.0,1,"Absolutely horrible how the Facebook is being ran as of late. You will be banned from the sites use for discussing science, math, firearms, voting, military, and pretty much whatever you can think of. If Facebook overlords disagree with anything you say whether actual fact or not then they will parade your post as false information all while banning you. They do not listen to their own community standards. I‚Äôm on my third ban for having discussions amongst my friends about windmill technologies. Yes, windmills. If you don‚Äôt like windmills then stay off Facebook because they will ban you for stating so. Absolute joke at this point. Do not recommend and honestly there is no such thing as the first amendment to them. It‚Äôs like trying to have a Facebook in communist China."

facebook,us,306.0,1,Why the dark mode disappeared after new update
facebook,us,306.0,1,Censorship at its finest. Unfair practices in suspending people with no ability to have recourse or redress.
facebook,us,306.0,2,"Although nice app for many reasons, I do find it very disappointing that there are features that are only available to select few and no matter how may ‚Äúupdates‚Äù you do on the app. Do not have access to these features. For example, the avatar feature has been out for almost a year now and my app has never had this feature. Only recently did the option to make an avatar on the app come up and when I clicked it, it said I needed to ‚Äúupdate‚Äù my app (the app was already completely updated) then when the next update came along, the option to create an avatar once again completely disappeared, nowhere to be found. As I said, very disappointing."
facebook,us,306.0,1,Horrible censorship of anything conservative!
facebook,us,306.0,4,It‚Äôs really freaking irritating when Facebook removes the mobile uploads & timeline photos albums. Why?! What is the point!!!! So stupid.

7 hours =/= 28 Minutes ding-dongs! Hit me up for more basic math and time telling help!

And 2 Minutes is actually not the same as 13 Minutes so WHY ARE YOU STILL LYING TO US?!?! PLEASEEEE just fix it!!!!!!

The latest version stoops down to showing a notification bubble for literally nothing. No new notifications/messages/alerts. It‚Äôs JUST there to make you open the app. Come on!

Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm apparently better at writing reviews than you are at fixing you own app. I kept a copy for you, since you delete my reviews on a regular basis despite not fixing the only problem mentioned in them. Losers.

Facebook deletes my reviews more often than its notifications are accurate. 

Months and months of fake notifications!

What is the point of telling me ‚ÄúDave just posted in Whatever-group‚Äù just to show me a post from days ago I saw already?

Who gains from you trying terribly to hide the fact that your notification is hours to days late? You STILL show the actual time of the post! We can all SEE you lying to us!

Every time I have to open and close the app for a fake notification I‚Äôm just going to come back and see if you‚Äôve deleted my review again!

I JUST closed the app! There‚Äôs nothing new about something I just saw from hours ago!

I promise we‚Äôre more sick of fake notifications than you are of these reviews!!

This app acts like a needy child, CHILL OUT!

New update, SAME OLD PROBLEMS!!!

Ughh STILLLLLL broken!!!

ALWAYS WRONG!!!

Whoops! You deleted this review again, but didn‚Äôt fix anything mentioned!! That seems lazy since there‚Äôs literally only one problem mentioned!

I just have this review on a note so I can replace it every time FaceBook censors it for some reason.

You know what would be less embarrassing than deleting legitimate reviews? Fixing the app!

Whoops, still wrong! Wrong on two separate occasions for the same old post!! WHY?!?!

Guess what? Lying about the same stuff is going to get this same review extended every time!

Jokes on you lazy-bones, I‚Äôve got the note copied to repost every time you take this down. Wouldn‚Äôt it look better to just fix it?

Nope, still wrong. Keep trying!

Good morning! Oh wait, nope, still just a bunch of spam from facebook.

Updated yesterday, broken today! Business as usual for these idiots. 

What‚Äôs the point of trying to claim ‚Äúbug fixes‚Äù on every update if we can all open the app and see for ourselves?

Wow this is crazy! So hear me out, for SOME reason, doing the same thing 5 minutes later about another old post doesn‚Äôt make us like it!

Still baffling that the concept of TIME ITSELF slips through the grasp of the almighty Facebook.

facebook,us,306.0,1,App is over rated at connecting socially. The algorithm sets it so you only see a few of your friends updates and keeps the rest hidden and you have to manually search to keep up with them. They stopped bringing al that information to you when they starting bombing the app down with ads. Targeted ads I mind you. You don‚Äôt like being sold a car by a pushy salesperson but you can deal with a sleazy app doing it. And grabbing all your personal info it can and storing it. Nope plenty and I mean plenty of other apps to connect with people and leave Facebook behind.

You're losing sales with that junk. I'll never click on or buy anything that autoplays with sound. I don't care if it's an ad for $4 oxygen if I'm trapped underwater.

Sorry Facebook, honestly I can‚Äôt really blame you, I blame the users and the culture that has come about. It‚Äôs unfortunate.

wanting to get more views to my page, i asked people to review/recommend, and got a few positive reviews/recommendation. it pushed my up to 3.7.

this morning i had 1 star out of 5. no one negatively reviewed me, i have one negative review out of 4, this rating doesn‚Äôt make a LICK of sense. through the app i can‚Äôt even access my reviews or see them, i have to go through browser to do so. but there‚Äôs no reason my reviews should have crashed like this.

facebook,us,306.0,1,Forced into ads and big following pages. Can‚Äôt even see my friends if I refresh or anything. Waste of time trying to enjoy being social on this platform
facebook,us,306.0,1,"Since update I have been requesting for day for support with no help. I haven‚Äôt been able to access fb dating. I used it before update, I live within US, uninstalled and reinstalled, rebooting phone, reset network settings, reset cache, no options anywhere in app."
facebook,us,306.0,1,"I don‚Äôt know what happened during the last update, but I am unable to see comment replies anymore. Please fix this, it‚Äôs extremely annoying. Thanks."
facebook,us,306.0,1,You guys have a poor response for the people asking for help to get back their account. Do better than that.
facebook,us,306.0,1,Suddenly I can‚Äôt get into my account and Facebook has yet to fix the issue I am so dissatisfied with this app like seriously !
facebook,us,306.0,1,Bloquean injustamente tiene demasiada publicidad y en pocas palabras esta aplicaci√≥n es una porquer√≠a al igual q todas las personas q se benefician de esta porquer√≠a de aplicaci√≥n
facebook,us,306.0,1,"It‚Äôs so confusing I didn‚Äôt understand to use it at all, they could have made it way clearer to use."
facebook,us,306.0,1,I been logged off Facebook for a month now and I keep saying that they received my information and stuff but I can‚Äôt see my timeline or anything.  And my. Account saying it‚Äôs disabled but I didn‚Äôt post anything that was negative to the Facebook community. I just want my page back
facebook,us,306.0,3,I need to be updated so I can create an avatar
facebook,us,306.0,1,"Facebook has permanently disabled my account 4 times. I provided a valid ID, I sent a photo of myself, I even recorded a video selfie for them and they still denied my review. Their AI is very sensitive and claims that I am violating Community Standards with my ads, yet I have no violated any. This does not support small business promotions. I also can‚Äôt appeal my review because they have already ‚Äúreviewed‚Äù my account, although their customer service is nonexistent. I‚Äôm done trying to promote my small business through Facebook, it‚Äôs very draining and tiring to continuously have to provide evidence of who you are when you‚Äôre trying to run a $10 ad. TLDR: F*uck Facebook, I‚Äôll stick with MeWe and Pinterest"
facebook,us,306.0,1,Facebook made a big nasty mistake!!!
facebook,us,306.0,1,"There is no reason that an app like Facebook to perform so poorly during light to medium usage. I use Facebook purely for the marketplace feature as other apps such as LetGo and OfferUp are bombarded with ads, however after 5 minutes of going through the Facebook Marketplace, my iPhone 11 Pro Max warms up and I notice that most actions are delayed such as exiting a listing or scrolling down. I have been using this app for several months and updated the app every time there was an update available and have not seen any improvement. Some times the marketplace feature would stay on the loading screen or wouldn‚Äôt even show any listings and only ads. Do better facebook, get rid of your boomer users if you have to"
facebook,us,306.0,1,"my facebook account is restricted but won‚Äôt tell me why or doesn‚Äôt even say it‚Äôs restricted. i can‚Äôt react or share for no reason at all, facebook just doesn‚Äôt want to see people happy"
facebook,us,306.0,1,"The app always has malfunction issues. I can rarely use marketplace without a glitch. The feed stream is nothing but ads. The feed updates randomly and sends you to the top feed which is annoying. I have to dig through my settings in the app and phone to be sure they don‚Äôt gain access to my personal information, which seems impossible to protect. Not only is the app invasive, it is riddled with glitches making it a frustrating experience to use."
facebook,us,306.0,2,"Why can‚Äôt the program be corrected to have all new notifications appear at the top of the list instead of scattered throughout? I scroll until I find a new notification and as I am about to open it, the list jumps back to either a new notification at the top or somewhere in the middle of the list that was already opened. Very frustrating so I don‚Äôt take the time to read many in my attempt to check them all. Also, stop the petty censorship."
facebook,us,306.0,2,Why am I logged out is it BECAUSE IM A KID I CAN READ AND SPELL
facebook,us,306.0,1,It seems that they got rid of the dark theme? Not a fan of that.
facebook,us,306.0,2,The app will not show the detail description on listed items in marketplace. I have reached out for help with no real assistance. It‚Äôs so frustrating.
facebook,us,306.0,1,We have no FRREDOM of speech today ! We have a false government trying to control our voices !   VERY EVIL ! I USE IT FOR A TOOL !   THE REAL NEWS !

I rarely see what my friends post and have groups and others that have taken over my newsfeed.  Plus, I hate that you can no longer delete Facebook ‚Äî you can just remove it from your Homescreen on the iPhone.  It stays in your App Library.  I HATE the new App Library too for iPhone... I‚Äôm seriously considering deactivating Facebook because of all the ads and the ads you have to watch while you‚Äôre watching videos... So ridiculous..."

It keeps saying an unexpected error has occurred and to try again later. I have my email I used to sign up for Facebook and my phone number but still can‚Äôt access my account.

It‚Äôs not a problem with anyone else‚Äôs feed but my own, Facebook needs to fix this."
facebook,us,306.0,1,tracks too much
facebook,us,306.0,1,"I‚Äôve had an account for 7 years and FB constantly sent me security checks where I had to upload my ID. Why? Who knows. Recently they did this again and I uploaded my ID to them and I got a msg they received it but due to Covid it would take longer to process. That was four months ago. My account is still disabled. They have no number or email to contact. I‚Äôve tried reaching them on other social media platforms. I msg‚Äôd random FB employees, I reported a million screenshots of the problem and even tried reaching them from my wife‚Äôs account. Nothing. 7 years of pictures and memories gone. /jaxrudebhoy"

facebook,us,306.0,2,I have had Facebook forever obviously. I use the app every day but I‚Äôve messaged support about 15 times to ask why I can‚Äôt scroll videos anymore? I‚Äôve googled and cannot find answers I‚Äôve deleted and re downloaded the app and still doesn‚Äôt work! Ugh is there anyone who found a solution pleaseeeee let me know üò≠üò≠üò≠
facebook,us,306.0,1,They‚Äôve hired censors to completely shut down anyone they don‚Äôt agree with politically. This platform has become one big liberal echo chamber. Many of my friends have gone to other more welcoming platforms. I wish I could give Facebook a zero. Go to MeWe or Gab. They‚Äôre more diversity of opinion friendly.
facebook,us,306.0,1,"You are seeing less and less of your friend's feed and more sponsored ads every hours of everyday it gets added no matter how little infos you have, how you tight up your privacy settings and ad settings whether you tried to hid them, it's impossible to turn it off entirely or block ads. You will still get them on desktop, Android or iOS regardless. And no Dark mode in over a year on iPad? What a joke Mark Zuckerberg's developers are."

I have looked up all the troubleshooting how-to‚Äôs as far as making sure the app is updated, going into setting and going under shortcut bar preferences (which the watch toggle is not there), all the way to offloading the app off of my phone and reloading, up to fully uninstall and reinstalling. Nothing as worked, and I get no response from sending a report."

facebook,us,306.0,1,Yep. Bye suckerberg
facebook,us,306.0,1,Haven‚Äôt been able to log in for over a month. Super disappointing as I do a lot of work for my business through Facebook and has turned into a huge inconvenience as I‚Äôm not always in front of my laptop and do a lot through my phone. Sent a mass email claiming the issue was fixed but turns out it‚Äôs still not.
facebook,us,306.0,1,I have been locked out of my account for 2 months. Facebook will not send a passcode to my email allowing me to reset my account.
facebook,us,306.0,1,"I always see important things get filtered out, yet see nazi pages, groups of pedos, and false information not being filtered out."
facebook,us,306.0,1,"So recently my Facebook was hacked. my email was changed so I‚Äôm unable to even change my password. I tried contacting Facebook to resolve this issue and they just kept sending me links to reset my password...how am I supposed to change my password when I don‚Äôt have access to the email account on file? To top it off the hacker set up the 2 step authentication so I‚Äôm completely locked out. It‚Äôs ridiculous, don‚Äôt even bother signing up if you haven‚Äôt already. Someone now has access to my personal info and I can‚Äôt even get it back because they‚Äôre customer service is trash. I tried explaining that it was hacked, showing photos of my ID but they‚Äôre a mega corporation so they don‚Äôt care about anyone. All they‚Äôll do is send you a link to change your password, which as I said in the beginning is useless. Thanks for nothing Facebook!"
facebook,us,306.0,1,Facebook is known for its liberal views and censors anything that does not agree with there views. You would be much better off with MeWe.
facebook,us,306.0,1,"I used to use the app all the time. They began censoring me and a lot of people I follow. My Facebook got deleted & I didn‚Äôt even do anything although they stated I didn‚Äôt follow ‚ÄúFacebook guidelines‚Äù though I rarely posted. I lost ALL of my memories & pictures I can‚Äôt get back. 

I also was on Facebook app and the app shut down & I can no longer login VIA the app. So, stupid. They need to update everything & getting a hold of Facebook support is the devil!"
facebook,us,306.0,2,How about on your next ‚Äúupdate‚Äù that you actually put the most recent posts on the timeline FIRST! So tired of seeing ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù wishes posted from the previous week and other posts from previous days. I remember the good old days when you weren‚Äôt bombarded with irrelevant ads every 5 posts. Do you guys actually pay attention to reviews and comments on how to make this app better??? All your ‚Äúfact-checking‚Äù has miraculously gone away since we have a new ‚Äúpresident.‚Äù Takes forever to load since the newest ‚Äúupdate.‚Äù At least you‚Äôre consistent in your updates.
facebook,us,306.0,2,It‚Äôs absolutely ludicrous. Every update is worse than the last. I can keep up with a conversation in a group anymore. It‚Äôs almost impossible to see what‚Äôs being said after any period of time on a post. The new algorithm puts new comments at the top making your read things out of order and mostly importantly out of context. Really annoying FB. Slowly transitioning the groups I manage to other platforms.
facebook,us,306.0,1,If they stopped social engineering and editing people out who have different political views could be a great app.

facebook,us,306.0,1,Marketplace is bad no body wants to buy shipped stop making it hard to buy local! The fact checkers are incorrect a lot and need to be sued. Do not recommend getting into Facebook kids eventually no one will be using it if the younger people stop making accounts
facebook,us,306.0,1,I have been censored and shadow banned for absolutely no reasons for many months. Facebook has become a communist party joke!!! I can‚Äôt stand where facebook is and what it stands for anymore. Change the name to Facecrook.

I was involuntarily logged out on Jan 22. The solution links offered were basically an endless loop. (If I was logged out of ALL my devices, using a device I already logged in with is not a solution. If I no longer receive 2 Factor Authentication codes, making me use one isn‚Äôt a solution.) 

I‚Äôve tried for a month sending my ID multiple times to verify my identity, now after easily 50 attempts at resetting my password thwarted by the inability to get passed 2 Factor authentication, I appear to be able to log in, but cannot see my feed or use Messenger. I get notifications on my phone,  but can‚Äôt view them in the app or post anything to my pages. There is NO way to contact support and report the problem. Shake my phone is idiotic and shows an error! 

After over a decade of using this app, I‚Äôve lost access to not only my personal page and groups, but I cannot access my business page that has a thousand followers. My desktop has a ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS and if I try to access and my phone I apparently log in, but all the feeds are

I have to find the name and then squint to read it. 

And now when I go to groups and click on the group I want I have to click ‚Äúgo to group‚Äù. Why are you adding another step? Why would I click the group if it wasn‚Äôt my aim to go to it?? Stop adding features no one wants that don‚Äôt make sense. Definitely someone at the company who just thinks their opinions need to be heard even though they are awful."

Now facebook is not whatIt was.

There‚Äôs no comment box to explain why you are reporting a profile. They give you very little options other than Fake Name or Fake Account but again, as long as there‚Äôs activity, the scammers and phishing scams go undetected. Facebook is a cesspool for this type of activity. Right now there are several fake scam accounts using Marketplace to scam people with the new PS5. But when you try to warn Facebook about these criminal profiles you get no where. Please add an option where the person doing the reporting can fill in a comment box as to why they are sounding the alarm and let us add photo evidence. Way to easy to hide criminal activity on Facebook! On top of that, Facebook is completely owned by various governments now and is no longer entertaining but a tool used for political manipulation.

facebook,ca,304.1,1,"When I first signed on in 2007 it was a good site for keeping in touch with friends and family.  Now there is too much insane and nonsensical censoring of Conservatives and Christians.  Your constant sending of  fact checkers after good people sucks.

Facebook‚Äôs ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù policies are idiotic and don‚Äôt solve the problem of hate speech on the internet at all. And they sell your info to third parties so they can spam f*ck you with ads.

facebook,ca,304.0,2,"Facebook used to be about connecting with family and friends.  It‚Äôs now a platform filled with conspiracy theorists, bits and trolls spreading disinformation.  Worse is the platform rewards these users while shunning long time users from reporting abuse and spread of hate filled speech. 

Until this platform can solve these issues, it is not something I would recommend anyone gets involved with.  It has introduced almost nothing but frustration into my life in the last few years."

I‚Äôve uninstalled the app and reinstalled it several times, restarted the iPad, which is always up to date, and searched for solutions from Facebook which are non existent. It is totally useless. Don‚Äôt waste the space on your device if storage is an issue. Download the Craigslist app instead."
facebook,ca,303.0,1,"Not user-friendly,  navigation isn‚Äôt clear like the web browser version. Easy to get lost on pages, profile pictures changing on their own (yes that really happened). There always seems to be a problem with this app. This app is too far deep in the into a hole to improve. Entire app will need to be re-engineered one day. Over the years it‚Äôs turned into a piece of ‚Äòcrap‚Äô for lack of a better term. All of the layers of improvements and everything Facebook has tried to add or modify about their app over the years has in effect ruined it."

facebook,ca,303.0,1,Can you guys think about allowing us on the platform without a personal account. I only use Facebook to promote my business page and I‚Äôm sick of the ridiculous and silly set  up you guys have for this. I don‚Äôt need double the amount of notifications and constant confusion through both sides of the app. Not only that but when I share my page to groups I have to do it through my personal page and people message me through my personal page rather than my business page I want to be just promoting my business page and quit changing it I‚Äôm sick of this Notification ‚Äúyou‚Äôre interacting with yourself now‚Äù. Like what‚Äôs that all about. I want to interact as my business not my personal account. You guys are making this way more complicated than it needs to be. Facebook isn‚Äôt used for just personal stuff anymore. Hope you evolve before someone else creates a new platform to fit our needs properly. Also think about getting a grown up to re-design the business page app because it‚Äôs like a two-year-old designed it and never used it after it‚Äôs completely useless. Businesses like myself pay you guys money to promote our pages the least you can do is make a proper app for us to do this. it‚Äôs not user-friendly at all and you just keep adding ridiculous stuff that isn‚Äôt even relevant and it just creates more glitches in the system. Call me when you want a real programmer.
facebook,ca,303.0,1,honestly just glitchy and outdated.
facebook,ca,303.0,1,Can‚Äôt pinch to zoom on marketplace images on iOS 14 and it‚Äôs been this way for months. Reinstall fixed it for a very short time before it‚Äôs broken again. How hard can it be to fix this Facebook developers??

What‚Äôs more irritating is when you go back in you can‚Äôt find the same feed. I don‚Äôt know why this is happening all of a sudden. On top of that even Marketplace stops listing after a while ; as there‚Äôs an add that crashes the whole thing. Whoever tweeked this update should be fired !!

I have no idea why because my name is not similar to any public figure I‚Äôve ever heard of and I don‚Äôt post pictures of celebrities, mention their names, etc. All I use it for is friending other players of my game. I‚Äôve had my account for years and I don‚Äôt know what the problem is! All they say is that it doesn‚Äôt follow community standards so it is disabled.

But now with all the censorship, the algorithms not doing what they should, the continued attempt at pushing their agenda and not just letting me see my friends posts and group posts that I‚Äôm in, I‚Äôm going to leave the platform in the New Year. It drives me crazy that I have to hunt for my friends posts and group/page posts and instead have stacks of random ads and things I‚Äôm not interested in all over my page feed."
facebook,nz,297.0,1,"I don‚Äôt consent to surveilance, nor do I consent to censorship, Facebook developers do not give u full disclosure on their policies therefore they deserve nothing ratings"
facebook,nz,297.0,1,Facebook has its ‚Äúfact‚Äù checkers constantly batting for big tech and the left. The truth has always been unpopular but it‚Äôs not Facebook‚Äôs role to determine what the truth is according to their flawed agenda.
facebook,nz,297.0,1,The fact checkers need fact checking. The censorship is exorbitantly ridiculous. No posting about your vaccine injured child but you can share a video of a child being beaten by his father. Go figure!
facebook,nz,297.0,1,"Stop the censorship 
That is not your job"
facebook,nz,297.0,1,Political interference. Censorship. Fact checker censorship. Not showing your friends list but random accounts you dont want to see.  Facebook is the ANTIsocial media.  Reject it

facebook,nz,297.0,1,"Suppressing free speech and invasion of privacy gets a no from me, Zuck the cuck."
facebook,nz,297.0,1,"Not happy with Facebook and their censorship, shadow banning, factcheckers and so on.

facebook,nz,297.0,1,Who are fact checking your fact checkers?
facebook,nz,297.0,1,"If I don‚Äôt say what they want I get censored.
Poor interface. Lots of bugs."
facebook,nz,297.0,1,The ‚Äòfact checkers‚Äô facebook employs who supposedly have a monopoly on ‚Äòtruth‚Äô are strongly biased (towards left wing politics) and are always trying to censor & block the truth.  I think facebook should aim to be politically neutral. But it isn‚Äôt.
facebook,nz,297.0,1,FB decides what is allowed to be said and what not. Too 1984 for me.
facebook,nz,297.0,1,"We do not need our social media to treat us like children. We can do our own research too see if someone else post/opinion is valid. We don't need a social media company to do it for us, especially one with a big bias."

facebook,nz,296.0,1,"Facebook is known for censoring people who speak out, who question things. They allow disgusting pedophiles and other disturbing content flush through Facebook, however ban those from sharing harmless topics or posts. Disturbing Facebook"
facebook,nz,296.0,1,How about some positive ethics Facebook?
facebook,nz,296.0,1,Sorry Facebook! I‚Äôll be saying goodbye to you. The censorship is disturbing!

facebook,nz,296.0,2,If opening from messenger any profile then FB doesn‚Äôt load that. It used to work ok before. Seems like something wrong now. Marketplace also keeps showing no results unless it is refreshed. Been very buggy.
facebook,nz,296.0,2,"I am having issues with texting anything in the market place response bar. When I click on it to type something, the keyboard pops up, but the screen above doesn't slide up so I can't see the text I am typing, quite frustrating. 
I am sure it's a glitch with the software and can be fixed easily. 
Thanks team.."
facebook,nz,296.0,1,"Facebook is biased and has one sided views in politics, plus cover up for filthy underhanded people.

If you debate anyone in their favour, like actually state the truth, you end up being deactivated!"

facebook,nz,296.0,1,Heavy handed censorship from ‚Äúfact checkers‚Äù.
facebook,nz,296.0,1,Shame on you
facebook,nz,296.0,1,"Current censorship is ridiculous

facebook,nz,295.0,2,Pleeeease bring back the feature photos on profile. PLEASE !
facebook,nz,294.0,1,I believe the app developers try really hard to see how many glitches they can produce with each new update and they succeed admirably with this goal. One has to wonder about the IT department.
facebook,nz,294.0,5,Hi mark I know you‚Äôre watching me through my camera :)

facebook,nz,293.0,1,Why doesn‚Äôt back button work on iPad?
facebook,nz,293.0,1,"So, this is the first time I use facebook on an iPad. It just seems like it doesn‚Äôt work. The back button doesn‚Äôt work ever and neither does the button that usually takes you to messenger. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve found so far and I‚Äôve only been using it on here for 2 days. It‚Äôs just not as easy to use on an iPad as it is on my phone or my laptop."
facebook,nz,293.0,5,"Despite all of the negative comments, I, for one, absolutely LOVE this app. It makes it a hundred times more easier to connect with friends and loved ones, upload and organize my pictures and I love all of the new looks and features it has now ü§© And it's all for FREE. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS APP and it will always be my favorite and go-to social app. Great job facebook team! ü•∞"
facebook,nz,293.0,1,Once again Facebook have broken the back button on this latest ‚Äòimproved‚Äô version. It is also getting very annoying having ads interrupt your videos at the most inappropriate moments.
facebook,nz,293.0,2,"Whenever i click on a live gaming video it just doesn‚Äôt do anything, if i go to a gamer‚Äôs page and click on his live video its just bounces me back on the gaming tab and still doesn‚Äôt play the video.

Here goes... Most recent update (06/20) is horrible! Nothing scrolls, notifications is a mess; nothing is up to date, and many notifications are missing or the entire scroll is out of order - plus it‚Äôs not clearing once you‚Äôve read through them. The recent posts on newsfeeds aren‚Äôt  even recent. The ‚Äòmost relevant‚Äô post setup is still really frustrating AF. It‚Äôs not feeling very ‚Äòcell phone‚Äô friendly either. It looks ‚Äò meh‚Äô. I can‚Äôt access my profile and page the way I want, and the new layout (on iPhone) looks awful. C‚Äômon FB. Please. Lift your game. K"
facebook,nz,274.0,1,Honestly I am very disappointed in Facebook right now I just got logged out of my account because of my NAME that is just my fursona‚Äôs name which is a part of me and I get called that by all my friends on there.

facebook,nz,273.0,1,"I enjoy, being able to communicate with people and observe or partake in discussions or group feeds. 
I don‚Äôt like, how you operate like a publisher rather than a platform these days and restrict or ban content that doesn‚Äôt agree with selective narratives.
To have free speech and a diverse community is a moral ideal for our future times. 
Independent critical thinking and public analysis allows for more open ended objectivity.
I would also prefer a team of people rather than a.i for handling support queries as I‚Äôve heard of many people and even businesses falling short and having nowhere to go with their feedback.
Also not a fan of how you sell our data. 
I would give Facebook a 1 star rating for these reasons. 
If Facebook was to improve I would be open to giving a better rating."
facebook,nz,273.0,2,Is there a way to change the setting in the app? My search button keeps disappearing and the only way to fix it is to re install. I‚Äôve done it a couple of time and it keeps disappearing.
facebook,nz,273.0,1,"I hate the new update that shows the ‚ÄúF‚Äù in the middle of the screen, at the bottom. It‚Äôs so difficult to use. I don‚Äôt understand why Facebook keeps changing layout and I can‚Äôt seem to get rid of it"

It systematically and purposely removes and suspends accounts of those who tell the Palestinian narratives of events or defend their right of freedom and self determination.

This results in you seeing the same posts over and over, or an inability to return to the same posts you saw earlier should you want to. 

Bring back the ‚ÄúMost recent‚Äù button in the next update. I want to be able to control how I see my friends posts, not you."

The algorithms are faulty. Basically how it works is FB times how long you look at posts for, and put the things you‚Äôve looked at for longer in your feed than shorter things. This gets really annoying because occasionally it will give you a ‚Äòwhat happens next‚Äô video that you have to watch for a while that about something you‚Äôre uninterested in, and because you watch it, your entire feed is filled up with pet videos and completely disregards all the billions of aviation videos and pics you‚Äôve watched, and your feed turns into a mess.

My friends have a company which produces shampoo to help re-grow hair and FB wouldn‚Äôt let them post a before and after picture. They have new rules that say that they want a healthier community and by posting that it may make other people not feel good about themselves. - seriously it‚Äôs a success story and their business and only people can control how they feel about things.

facebook,nz,240.0,3,"The main reason I use Facebook is for the invitation communities and because you can save images easily (my photo library is full of thousands of aeroplane pics), but that‚Äôs really all that I use it for.
The algorithms are faulty. Basically how it works is FB times how long you look at posts for, and put the things you‚Äôve looked at for longer in your feed than shorter things. This gets really annoying because occasionally it will give you a ‚Äòwhat happens next‚Äô video that you have to watch for a while that about something you‚Äôre uninterested in, and because you watch it, your entire feed is filled up with pet videos and completely disregards all the billions of aviation videos and pics you‚Äôve watched, and your feed turns into a mess.

Moving towards a very communistic and socialist website. 
Will switch to new pages that have freedom on speech soon. Jordan Peterson is launching thinkspot. 
My friends have a company which produces shampoo to help re-grow hair and FB wouldn‚Äôt let them post a before and after picture. They have new rules that say that they want a healthier community and by posting that it may make other people not feel good about themselves. - seriously it‚Äôs a success story and their business and only people can control how they feel about things. So if we all had more confidence we wouldn‚Äôt be having these problems and having everything censored. 
Great photo posting and location tagging as well as events.

facebook,sg,297.0,2,"Facebook has the poorest help centre. It took me 3 days to navigate to get in touch with the help centre or what is it called. There is no email or helpline to report a serious issue and dispute. It makes me want to give up technology even though I‚Äôm just in my early 30s. 

Somehow, my business page has been hacked (not sure how, and it linked to my account as the admin). A hacker used it to post inappropriate advertisement content (picture of female, and the advertisement target male in Taiwan.) How could Facebook even approve of such AD when my business is interior design? 

My PayPal account linked to Facebook has been charged and somehow there was no notification that prompt my action. 

I have post inquiry to Facebook twice due to the dispute charges of more than $600 usd. First reply was super lame and they claimed that there was unusual activity but they rectified, reactivated my account and payment without even asking if I feel safe or compensating me! AND THEY JUST CLOSE THE CASE WITHOUT ALLOWING ME TO ASK FURTHER QUESTION. I reported again with all the detailed descriptions and payment transactions, and it has been more than 1 week now and there is still no further action plan from Facebook side. 

All, please be careful before committing so much money into advertisement in Facebook. The platform itself is not safe based on my experience and I presume many hackers are making use of this opportunity (poor app management with poor screening of authenticity) to create all these frauds, thinking it can blend without people knowing and Facebook will just approve anything without flagging.

facebook,ie,271.0,1,Free Palestine
facebook,ie,271.0,1,"Facebook was a vey good social media platform for people to freely publish what they want.
Facebook now is removing number of posts and photos that are connected with Palastine. Even preventing people from using Facebook for posting such that cause.
Facebook should be as before free to use for everybody, every-political view and not to stop people to share what is happening in the world."
facebook,ie,271.0,1,Palestine üáØüá¥üáØüá¥
facebook,ie,271.0,1,Facebook censors as it wishes. It‚Äôs not a platform that respects differences. Facebook politicises everything
facebook,ie,271.0,1,Its anti-Palestinian policies are appalling.
facebook,ie,270.1,1,"If you write anything to support Palestinian against Israel occupation then you will get your post deleted and band but if you support the criminals of Israel then it‚Äôs ok, hopefully Facebook changes their policy and stay away from Palestinians when they try to at least defend themselves by writing the truth , I‚Äôm really disgusted with their stupid policy which is the same as Israeli"
facebook,ie,270.1,1,Ok so I had Facebook and I have now deleted the app like 2 months and they are still sending me messages please stop the messages please
facebook,ie,270.1,1,"Why do I not have the option for the Avatar App? I have the latest version of Facebook installed, I also deleted the App and reinstalled it to see if that would work and I still don‚Äôt have it! Anyone else with the same issue?"
facebook,ie,270.0,2,I purchased a chromecast in March and was able to cast videos from Facebook on my iPhone to my tv but have not been able to do it for the last two weeks. It‚Äôs impossible to contact Facebook to see what the problem is
facebook,ie,270.0,1,"I am just wondering why Facebook hasn‚Äôt really gotten with the times!, and implemented Dark mode!. It can‚Äôt be that hard to do, all these updates there asking us to do and not the ones we want!, surely the app can‚Äôt be that broken in two weeks that it needs another update. When will this be happening?."
facebook,ie,270.0,1,I can no longer share post as my page that is linked to my group
facebook,ie,269.0,1,15-20 second ads during a video will make me turn off the rest of the video
facebook,ie,268.0,1,I hate this stupid app. It‚Äôs literally only ads and idiots sharing things that aren‚Äôt true. Deleted. My mum still uses it though.
facebook,ie,267.0,1,Too many ads. Can‚Äôt enjoy scrolling through feed.

facebook,ie,266.0,3,when dark mode ?
facebook,ie,265.1,1,Give us Truong Sa & Hoang Sa back!!!!!
facebook,ie,265.1,1,Getting progressively worse with time. I get very very few posts from friends and it‚Äôs limited to a select few at that. I understand ad revenue keeps the platform free BUT ads at the expense of seeing actual posts from people I know is just defeating the purpose of SOCIAL media.
facebook,ie,264.0,3,"The app keeps crushing 
And we you save a video it freeze and crash FYI..."
facebook,ie,264.0,2,I‚Äôm having to use google chrome to access my notifications if I miss when they pop up! It‚Äôs quite difficult to respond via google chrome as it puts spaces when not needed or leaves out words!
facebook,ie,260.0,2,How do you even delete your account?! I don‚Äôt want this anymore!!!
facebook,ie,260.0,1,Poorly optimised app for the iPhone. Not able to edit the radius for distance within marketplace section because the drop menu glitches off the screen.

facebook,ie,254.0,1,This app was uninstalled yesterday. Prior to uninstalling my phones battery needed to be charged at least 2 times a day. After uninstalling it and no power saving turned on my phone lasts the whole day on one charge alone. Same for messenger. Huge battery drain. Please fix and I will reinstall.
facebook,ie,253.0,1,On my business page I can no longer SHARE stuff to other pages to promote my business but my partner can on his app? His sharing is also made much easier with his app he can share to multiple pages whereas I could only share to one page at a time and now I can‚Äôt share at all?????
facebook,ie,252.3,1,"Iphone Xs Max , facebook stop working !!!!"
facebook,ie,251.0,1,"Since the update that changed how comments are viewed it‚Äôs a disaster trying to read a post. The most recent is first and then some are hidden too unless you click to show all. Please FB, return it to how it was so we can follow a thread how it was meant to be read and not have to start at the bottom üôÑ."
facebook,ie,251.0,1,My surname is lord and I can‚Äôt enter it into Facebook because you can‚Äôt use a fake name but I‚Äôm not please fix this
facebook,ie,251.0,2,"Facebook has become a disaster. Forgot password. Tried to reset. It‚Äôs sending my reset to an email I used 8 years ago and is dead. I updated my new email twice since with FB. 

Regardless it doesn‚Äôt give me a reset option with my phone despite my phone being registered. 

I am still logged into Messenger which shows my number attached. 

I wrote complaints through Messenger but they ignore. I have emailed the company with passport several time to request code is sent to my phone. They ignore. 

Any communication from them is in the reset password section which says. We can‚Äôt verify you so your account will stay active until we can. 

I have been through their automated reset system so many times it‚Äôs frustrating. 

The company is shocking."
facebook,ie,251.0,1,Since this update there is a fault in sending/sharing  posts from fb to individuals on messenger
facebook,ie,251.0,1,More shady practices for a number and account that has already been 'authenticated'.
facebook,ie,251.0,1,"I know everyone is gonna use facebook but it just feels like a sell-out - Adds all the time in every video, under the videos, sometimes even multiple times in 1 video. 
Secondly - app refreshes every time i switch from app to another app and back.
Thirdly - videos crash constantly - stop loading and go to black screen. (And theres 0 chance its my phones fault)
Something is seriously gone bad with facebook lately"
facebook,ie,251.0,1,"I‚Äôm not getting notifications on time or not at all the posts I‚Äôm following....This is happening for quite a while it was same for previous update and the previous update...
App has section for gaming which is new and a good thing but in video tab we still see gaming videos so what‚Äôs the point of having separate tab then that need to be fixed I think videos should be categorized when they are posted so they fall in their respective section. I hope you will fix these issues....."
facebook,ie,250.0,1,Trying to find a video is impossible such a bad app
facebook,ie,250.0,3,Sometimes it kicks me out for no reason
facebook,ie,250.0,1,"As the title suggests, nothing but adverts. Even though I've gone through preferences and blocked what I could, especially alcohol adverts. -1000 out of 10 for caring more about what advertisers pay you and not what the people want."
facebook,ie,249.0,1,"Why is it not downloading taking forever
 1/2 star"
facebook,ie,248.1,1,"I used to be an avid user of Facebook. However, facebook‚Äôs unwillingness to tackle disinformation is simply inexcusable. Allowing Anti-Vaccination campaigns, allowing individuals and organisations to spread climate denial, and allowing political campaigns and target advertising which are not fact checked. Banning disinformation is not censorship. It is preventing those knowingly spreading disinformation to further their own goals. I would even go as far as saying that Facebook has become a threat to society. With over 2.4 billion users (2019) it is inexcusable that Facebook does nothing on these issues. I never write reviews on Apps but I feel very strongly on this. I hope that Facebook addresses these serious issues but judging on their lack of action to date, I‚Äôm an not optimistic on this matter."
facebook,ie,247.0,3,"Great tool for businesses and keeping in touch with friends and communities. A great source of information. However, many of the algorithms seem to be unecessarily complicated leading to a large app size and poor performance even at a basic level. For example started a new page for my business recently and 3 key things do not function whatsoever. 

Invite friends does not show any friends

Description being ‚Äúfalse‚Äù despite being fully accurate
 
Cannot add the about tab to the tabs visible on my page. 

Since i have created and moderated many pages i know similar issues are pretty much standard and very frustrating. Sometimes can be overcome by using a different browser but considering their simplicity its hard to understand how they do not function without showing up as an error at the very least."
facebook,ie,247.0,1,"Fb app is glitching on Iphone 6(software up to date). Every time I go into someones profile or even click on a picture on the newsfeed app makes it hard to go back to newsfeed. It turns on the camera for some reason, and camera takes around15% of the screen untill I scroll down."
facebook,ie,247.0,1,The app automatically updated yesterday and it has not worked since won‚Äôt load or refresh

facebook,ie,244.0,1,Every time I update the app my settings get changed and I have to disable in app sound. Now sound plays in videos even though in app sounds are disabled and my phone is set to silent. What's the point in even having settings when they keep getting changed?
facebook,ie,243.0,1,Stop adding sections to the bottom of the app. What‚Äôs the point having a video section if you‚Äôre gonna have videos show up in the main feed tab anyway? Also the group tab is also pointless
facebook,ie,242.0,1,Seriously? I cannot be going into settings every day to tell it that I don‚Äôt want in App sounds over and over and over again. What part of ‚ÄúNo‚Äù doesn‚Äôt the App understand. Fix this fast!
facebook,ie,242.0,1,Don‚Äôt know what bugs you all are fixing every week but after the latest update I‚Äôm not able to see who is going to my event. Every time I click onto the list of people ‚Äúgoing‚Äù the app closes and crashes.
facebook,ie,241.0,2,"Rarely do facebook updates add anything for me. Mostly they take away features I like (easy option to view your feed in chronological order for instance) or add ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù (add and promoted posts for example) I don‚Äôt want. 
This update, however, has decided that my opinion in having the in-app sounds set to ‚Äúoff‚Äù is clearly the wrong choice, and is quick to overrule my decision every time I launch the app. 
AI gone too far perhaps?"

facebook,ie,238.0,1,"Ads ads ads, spam, FB is getting more about marketing and sales rather than photos and sharing your experiences with YOUR friends. 95% of my feed is marketing. You won't broaden your horizons here, quite the opposite. Everything is targeted to make you buy stuff or go to places where you will spend your money. Boring."
facebook,ie,237.0,1,Facebook are a disgrace they allow bullies have a free reign bud block those who stand up to bullies and warn others against nasty trolls and bullies. They also allow blatant pornographic content and when it is reported they do nothing about it. It is the worst app for bullying and harassment and punishes those who fight back.

facebook,ie,208.0,1,"It is incredibly annoying to not be able to see the newsfeed in chronological order, like if you are on your laptop.

facebook,ie,206.0,1,"1. It's boring
2. The interface is too busy
3. Loads of useless content 
4. Needs more user control
5. Needs simplifying
6. Adverts need to be basic and contrast away from posts
7. Bug with videos when listening with headphones.
8. Friendship feels separate from the function of the app.
9. Disjointed with it being separated from messenger. 
10. Too invasive with unnecessary notifications
11. Difficult to dismiss bits of interface you don‚Äôt want to see.
12. No dark mode!!!
11. Depressing to use.
Etc...

Seriously Facebook this list goes on."

facebook,ie,199.0,2,Getting sick of the way the groups are. Most groups only show top posts. I want to see recent posts. There used to be a sort button but it‚Äôs disappeared since I updated the app.

facebook,ie,198.0,1,"Facebook is flushing itself down the drain with so many bad decisions. You cannot force me to start using the messenger by just refusing access to my messages in Facebook. Everybody knows you will start charging us with the new msg app. Not good. Disappointed.

312MB for just the Facebook app? I now have to upgrade my phone so your analytics, stickers and other bloatware would fit onto my device?
You‚Äôre killing it."

facebook,ie,196.0,2,"Since the last update, my ‚Äòmost recent posts‚Äô are completely out of order and not recent at all. Doesn‚Äôt seem to be any sort of logic to they way they are showing up.

facebook,ie,196.0,1,"Every few days there is an update and each one gets worse. Notifications are staying on for days even though I‚Äôve read them all.

facebook,ie,194.0,1,The latest update constantly crashes. I've never experienced this from a Facebook app before. Very disappointed.
facebook,ie,191.0,1,Keeps crashing on my iphone 5
facebook,ie,191.0,1,Whatever Facebook did in the last update the screen goes blank after a few seconds and the app crashes
facebook,ie,191.0,2,App keeps closing on iPad. Won't stay open for more than 5 seconds since last update. Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling but still no good. Works fine on PC.
facebook,ie,191.0,1,A trash app... getting all time errors .. i can‚Äôt even open it
facebook,ie,191.0,1,"The latest updates have completely destroyed the news feed. I can‚Äôt see the pages I like, I can‚Äôt see the pages my friends like. 9 day old status updates from friends as the most recent activity? This app is completely broken it‚Äôs not worth having on your device."
facebook,ie,191.0,1,Keeps crashing after latest update.
facebook,ie,191.0,2,This new update is causing the app to crash and exist the application
facebook,ie,190.0,4,It works ok
facebook,ie,189.0,1,Hi Facebook ..recent update has locked me out from using the online market place
facebook,ie,189.0,1,All that‚Äôs visible in my newsfeed is post after post from the same fb group. Scrolling and scrolling only shows group updates from the same group. Kill app and similar occurs with different fb group but same concept. V frustrating.
facebook,ie,189.0,5,Great app for everything sorry I don‚Äôt have anything else but that‚Äôs quite it
facebook,ie,189.0,1,"any setting i have tried to go in to all i get is a blank screen,try delete something that doesn‚Äôt work either whats going on i have contacted you many times about it with no reply"
facebook,ie,188.0,1,"App won't let download 
Says temporarily unavailable 
Can anyone help me with this"
facebook,ie,187.0,1,Why in the world there is still no support of iPad Pro 12.9? The app looks just horrible- the scaled version of 9.7 iPad. How many years you need to fix that???
facebook,ie,187.0,3,The app for my phone has more available on it than the app for my iPod. ie: no marketplace on ipod
facebook,ie,185.0,1,My news feed is totally blank. And the page freezes. What‚Äôs going on?
facebook,ie,185.0,1,"Not only am I always seeing the same posts but I realise that I am not shown a lot of posts from people on my friends list.  How dare Facebook decide whose posts I see? This very controlling as well as infuriating! On top of that, each time I watch a video on landscape view it automatically switches to portrait view and I have to turn off the app as nothing will make it go back to landscape view. I think Facebook is going downhill and I agree with all the other reviews here. If I don‚Äôt go to a particular page, I won‚Äôt see that person‚Äôs posts and the newsfeed has become very selective and repetitive. As for Ads, a lot of them are mostly trying to catch people out.  No longer a trustworthy app!

UPDATE 
my comments do not show up where I write them! had to rewrite one 3 times and still no sign of it on the page, though they show up on my activity log. so I have wasted my time for nothing and my comment is still not there! what‚Äôs the story? i am quite annoyed! also, how can I get back to a newsfeed that includes the pages I like? Facebook, youre getting worse. As for your App support, there‚Äôs no support at all, just a page of FAQs."
facebook,ie,185.0,3,"I don‚Äôt know how the App is workin on other iPads. I tried to delete and reinstall the app again many times, so I think it‚Äòs a bug. On iPhone and iPod all features works really fine. 

If I try on iPad to view announced Birthdays, or follow some fb internal links (events, pages) in comments. If I want to get viewed such notifications I always get the information on a grey background that there is no internet connectivity.

Would be fine if it gets resolved with the next updates."
facebook,ie,184.0,1,Marketplace is crap. Also what‚Äôs up with the same notification popping up again and again?
facebook,ie,184.0,1,Hate it now the friends lists have been removed. Used these so I could find everyone but now I get nothing. I‚Äôve deleted the app as it‚Äôs useless now!
facebook,ie,184.0,3,I have new notifications then I click on it within an hour they are back not clearing
facebook,ie,184.0,2,Since the latest update my notifications don‚Äôt clear! Facebook says I have 9 notifications but I already saw them. Beginning to get really annoying!
facebook,ie,183.0,1,I opened facebook without using it for a couple of months. Then an update screen cans up. It just had update ... and no cancel button to continue using the old version. Why do these companies do that. A user should always have a choice. Not to mention all the constant reminder to sync to emails and other apps to store my information and do god knows what with it.
facebook,ie,183.0,1,"Guys, if I don‚Äôt want to install my latest update, you cannot force me to do it! It is not compulsory and this app is getting more and more rubbish with every update !"
facebook,ie,183.0,3,It ok. Just had to delete and re-install the app for them to show up again
facebook,ie,182.0,1,Facebook is getting worst and worst.  New upgrade new problems.
facebook,ie,182.0,1,Facebook is barely usable now with its constant irrelevant ads. Even when watching a video it will interrupt the video to show an ad. Absolutely ridiculous.
facebook,ie,182.0,1,"Since the influx of adverts all throughout our timeline I have seen countless adds for pages and websites offering what are clearly false deals. I have not been a victim as I work in data security and know what to look out for. However I know multiple people who have been scammed. 

I now advise anyone who is not very computer savvy to avoid and delete this app until resolved."
facebook,ie,182.0,1,Since the last update if I log out of my account the app shuts down and won‚Äôt open again. I‚Äôve had to delete and reinstall it to get it to work every time
facebook,ie,182.0,1,"For the last couple of weeks now every single video in FB stops playing, shows as buffering and stays like that. The only way I can view something is by using the rewind and going back 10 increments at a time then it plays a little further. It is not my WiFi, nor is it my data connection. It happens in every location no matter what internet I am connected to."
facebook,ie,181.0,1,"I reposted a meme I found on Facebook, they flagged it and put me on a ban, after getting it reviewed Facebook said it didn‚Äôt go against their community standards but have left me on the ban."
facebook,ie,180.0,1,"I'm sorry but your updates are extremely poor it's so slow to open even over wifi it is freezing and crashing I updated to iOS 11.4 today and it's gotten worse if you are going to do updates every 2 weeks at least fix the problems I cannot be bothered anymore it's taking up 2.3gb of storage and it just pisses me off stories aren‚Äôt loading I‚Äôm only seeing stuff from 2 weeks ago

facebook,ie,179.0,1,It keeps freezing then it‚Äôs rebooting itself.
facebook,ie,179.0,1,Facebook is awful I‚Äôve gotten hacked twice already and my account has gotten deleted. FACEBOOK YOUR A DISGRACE
facebook,ie,178.0,1,"Why every simple task on facebook require separate app. 
Has Facebook designer and coder cannot make this this in one app.

Sorry i am lamer but know that dividing everything is not good think, it just piss me off. 
I can see marketplace on facebook app, but in maessanger i try to display the ads for ehich i got reply, and open website - DOWNLOAD MARKEPLSCE APP. 

Sweet lord, i have enough this horrrible policy of facebook. They should have some serious lesson of create usefull app. 

And this size of app, scandal."
facebook,ie,178.0,1,Latest update has bugs guys. Needs to be sorted.
facebook,ie,177.0,1,These days Facebook is taking so much ads which are so much annoying
facebook,ie,176.0,1,"Facebook App where to begin, it‚Äôs a massive no no from me video‚Äôs don‚Äôt play, photos don‚Äôt load on the time line. And these pages constantly asking for consent to share my information that don‚Äôt give you the option to opt out of the information sharing is ridiculous. I‚Äôm so sick of inappropriate videos of babies getting beating up and just abusive videos in general and even when it‚Äôs been reported it‚Äôs deemed appropriate. But yet a video or photo of breastfeeding is removed. Pls sort out this issue or I‚Äôm deleting the app"

facebook,ie,171.0,1,"Latest version doesn't work - it's as simple as that - and hasn't worked since the update was effected. 
I would give zero stars but the review wouldn't accept less than one. 
An appalling mess on the iPhone - running iOS7 - which multiple deletions and reloading of the app haven't resolved the 3-4 day old problem. 
FACEBOOK! Your customers deserve better than this shabby treatment. 
Go fix!

And might you good people at Facebook try to explain why, in the cutting edge temple of technology which Facebook purports to be, the app needs to update every week - ten days and how it now needs 310Mb, with the separate Messenger element needing another large tranche of memory."
facebook,ie,170.1,2,It keeps freezing since last update .. I have to keep removing Facebook from the iPad to reinstall it... it‚Äôs driving me mad now ..
facebook,ie,170.1,1,The new updates real weird for tagging it‚Äôs taking me so long
facebook,ie,170.0,1,Facebook was so good but this new update is terrible.
facebook,ie,170.0,2,The new format is inconvenient and the old one was so much smoother and easier to continuously watch videos related to the one you just watched.
facebook,ie,169.0,2,"The new layout is nice, except for the removal of the option to filter by ‚Äòrecent‚Äô. Most of what I see is posts from 4 days ago that Facebook thinks I‚Äôll like. I‚Äôd actually like some new content, thanks. 
Also the false ads, especially dangerous in Ireland right now considering the 8th Amendment Referendum. People clearly getting away with pages pedalling mis-information. 
Uninstalled."
facebook,ie,169.0,1,"We just need a new social media application, Facebook know that they don‚Äôt have rivals this is why they slowing down, if you don‚Äôt accept ads or you don‚Äôt watch ads or oblige to sign for different rules which is not in our favor . 
They become so rich and so powerful that they buying governments from all around the world . Our governments instead protect us or our rights they are working for Facebook 
We need competitors"
facebook,ie,168.0,1,"Used to be good, now not so much. Filled with nothing more other than irrelevant ads and memes. It doesn‚Äôt show actual content from friends anymore, just likes. Also the timeline seems inconsistent, showing things from 5 days ago to something posted 5 mins ago. Also uses lots of memory, I would delete but have too many pictures saved to the app and don‚Äôt have enough space on my phone. Also, one of the most annoying things is the FB ‚Äúcommunity standards‚Äù. They seem to allow the most offensive content remain on the app, but something innocent is removed due to being against these so called ‚Äúcommunity standards‚Äù. It literally removed a satirical article I had shared (the original post on the original page remained up yet the one I shared was removed?) which had a thumbnail of a guy in bicycle shorts?!! Yet, a video showing someone die remained up. Seems to be no logic to these standards, or to this app anymore."
facebook,ie,168.0,1,"Battery draining on my iPhone X, it wasn‚Äôt like this until iOS 11.3, it‚Äôs not using a lot more power than it used to"
facebook,ie,167.0,1,Facebook has become a grotesque shadow of what it initially was a decade ago or so. Censorship and a privacy nightmare. Deleted today.
facebook,ie,166.0,1,"Ads ads ads, no state saving"
facebook,ie,166.0,1,"I installed the latest update on Sunday April 8th, and i am sorry I did.
My news feed has been destroyed, top stories stay the same for hours, even at that there were no more than 10 posts on that feed, most recent will show something from a few min ago and the next post is what i saw the previous time I logged on!!
I even had to search family members to see their recent posts, as I knew they had posted but it wasn‚Äôt coming up on my page feed.
Why does a company like Facebook always try to improve everything, but actually only make it worse.
Might be no harm if it stays the way it is, it‚Äôs giving me a genuine reason to delete it."
facebook,ie,165.0,1,"Worse and worse it‚Äôs getting, just getting used to the way it is and it changes!!"
facebook,ie,165.0,1,Crap most of the time
facebook,ie,164.0,1,Shame on you for personal data hacking. It should be banned by the EU for their breech of trust.
facebook,ie,163.0,1,"I honestly praise Facebook for everything , I think we all know what it‚Äôs like , good social media app to interact with friends but ads are honestly so unreliable on Facebook!!! 

It‚Äôs unbelievable, it started off okay , most ads were normal ads , with real prices from REAL COMPANIES but it soon went downhill.... all they now do is post fake ads that lead to fake websites which will just scam you from money. I have been scammed like this plenty of times , I recently bought something for ‚Ç¨50 then all my ‚Äú recently bought history ‚Äú was erased and over ‚Ç¨200 was taken from my account.... it‚Äôs so embarrassing on how many occasions I‚Äôve had to call into my bank and tell them that I‚Äôve been scammed again and that I need to somehow get my money back....  AGAIN! It has happened on numerous occasions and I‚Äôm glad and very thankful to say that each time I‚Äôve received my money back but not everyone is that lucky.... some people don‚Äôt even realise that their money is being stolen ..
I am very disappointed in Facebook when it comes to ads , I understand that they need sponsorships to make money but this is disgusting how they allowed any website onto such a big platform and allow people to be scammed left and right !! 
I really hope they fix this because I‚Äôm loosing my faith in Facebook ."
facebook,ie,162.0,1,"After update my news feed became very short/ limited. Contacted support multiple times- no answer from them.
Another update- the app just stopped working, completele ingnorance from support"
facebook,ie,162.0,2,"I have 2 big issues with Facebook I set up a page called Baby Bella blankets nearly 3 years ago When I set the page up I set it up as a community page as I crochet baby blankets for family & friends as presents. I also make blankets to donate to local NICU & for Angel babies. I have sold 5 blankets during this time as they would have been from people coming across my page & contacting me. 
I have emailed FB on numerous occasions to get my page put.back to its original way & remove business from it but nothing has happened except I got hours of business hours added to which I have it closed most of the time. I have had to do this as people contacting during the night. I have been tempted to close the page & reopen under a slightly different name but don‚Äôt want to loose my likes.

A couple of weeks ago I got some sort of virus through an add I looked at . I was lucky I stopped immediately by changing my passwords but some off my friends got hacked 

I am also annoyed with messenger telling me it wants to upload all my contracts from my phone to it so more people can contact me easier. Why is this happening?"
facebook,ie,161.0,1,"Never update. You never know what your update does. Sometimes it‚Äôs good, but most updates are Facebook experiments."
facebook,ie,161.0,1,Just updated again and it keeps crashing
facebook,ie,160.0,1,Timeline is crap!! Keep seeing posts from days ago and the most recent shortcut doesn‚Äôt work. Also I don‚Äôt care when people comment on adds
facebook,ie,158.0,5,"I love this app, great with connecting friends together and has an easy to get to lay out"
facebook,ie,157.0,1,"Update always crash, also fb contols post. It does not always show all posts from all frienda. There are too much advertisement, data is not secure and you search something on google and you can see the related ads on facebook."
facebook,ie,156.0,5,Before Facebook was very heavy to used in mobile. Now it‚Äôs great! And well organised and secure. And big thanks to all Facebook teams.
facebook,ie,155.0,2,Would like to know if someone has seen a message in the messenger timeline. It‚Äôs changed in the new update
facebook,ie,155.0,1,"If you refresh group page discussion more than once the app will crash straight away, watching a video and while trying to close the video by down swipe will make the screen goes black and the audio of the video will still kept on unless you close the app and open again, need to fix these and give us more improvement with more options like on desktop."
facebook,ie,154.0,1,"Newsfeed no longer works. Displays ""no stories to show"" and that's the end of it. What the hell is the point of the app if it can't even do the ONE thing it's there for ?! Disgrace"

Plz make new update"

facebook,ie,152.0,1,Closing while watching videos after this new update.
facebook,ie,152.0,1,Happening to all videos
facebook,ie,151.0,1,The last update was crap. Now I can‚Äôt watch live video properly. I don‚Äôt like to watch the full video then I always use to watch the important parts. Now I can‚Äôt do that. Pls do something about that. Thank u!
facebook,ie,150.0,1,For the past month or so my Facebook newsfeed is completely limited and boring. I can only see about 2 new things per day everything else is the same stuff from the days before. It doesn‚Äôt show anything my friends are posting. Also the ads in the middle of videos is ridiculous. I wouldn‚Äôt mind watching at the beginning SOMETIMES but when you‚Äôre watching a 30 second video and get a ten second ad in the middle it just infuriates me. App has gone drastically down hill. Considering deleting if it doesn‚Äôt improve
facebook,ie,150.0,1,"Facebook operates perfectly- too perfect, in fact. The whole point of Facebook is to invade every little thing in your life, and it, along with other social media, is succeeding. I am constantly fed notifications, most of which are irrelevant. This is purely to get you on to Facebook and see their ads. I have tried to have a few different profiles to be blocked, and every time I was met with the response that Facebook has reviewed the profile/page, and has found that the page does not go against the Community Guidelines. I have tried to block accounts blatantly trying to promote prostitutes, and pages abusing whole organisations with stupidity and ignorance. The whole website disgusts me, yet unfortunately I must stay on it as it is normal and many clubs which I am part of use it. I am a student in an exam year, and I have constantly been getting notifications from Facebook and other social media. It has ruined my study, and my grades are slowly getting worse. I am deleting notifications, and only turning on Facebook and other social media when I really need to. It is a time-waster, and is morally wrong. I would give zero stars if it were possible."
facebook,ie,150.0,1,Find myself using this app less and less
facebook,ie,150.0,1,This yoke of thing is acting the mick I miss me oul Facebook it‚Äôs not thesame i am dedicated user and upset to see the old version go I hate the new version and the fish market of a yoke on the bottom and I hate the noticaftion simble it‚Äôs bollox

facebook,ie,150.0,1,"Absolutely awful app, newsfeed never refreshes and I‚Äôm left seeing things from over a week ago. Absolutely ridiculous. Will be uninstalling the app"
facebook,ie,148.0,2,"I haven't been receiving any notifications since I last updated the app. Also, the addition of ads in the middle of watching a video has been infuriating, to the point I skip the ad AND the video just to feel at ease!"
facebook,ie,148.0,2,Never had a problem with the app before but since the last update I can‚Äôt share anything. When I click the share button it goes black then exits the app. And I got a lot of memes to share...
facebook,ie,148.0,1,Since this or the last update I can't see any comments in just about everything in my news feed. Like what the hell is that crap.
facebook,ie,147.0,1,Really bad
facebook,ie,147.0,2,My Facebook keeps changing back to the old updates what‚Äôs happening??? Can‚Äôt see the market place or anything anymore
facebook,ie,147.0,1,"Why the does everyone keep on commenting fake under every post, change this so I can't see the comments"
facebook,ie,147.0,1,They would listen to my conversations and the next day id have a add about what i was talking about and it literally stalks what ur doing...yes its good to communicate but i think its time to delete my Facebook account
facebook,ie,146.0,2,"Hey there,

Long term dedicated user of the Facebook mobile app, and previously a very happy customer. However the last two updates had completely slowed down the app for me and whenever I open it it‚Äôs just a blank grey and mostly unresponsive loading screen. Seriously got to get it fixed guys! I cannot spend over 2 minutes waiting for an app to open or load when every other major app takes less than 10 seconds"
facebook,ie,146.0,5,"This is an app to keep up with friends ,To keep up with local news , natural disasters, from happy birthdays to funerals, scorelines to shorelines, competitions to superstitions , first steps to great depths , it will suck you in ,first thing when you wake and last peak before sleep  and all it took was the app from Facebook."
facebook,ie,146.0,1,"When you're scrolling down the selfie camera constantly activates and makes the app freeze for about ten seconds. 

Unusable"
facebook,ie,145.0,1,The news feed does not seem to be working on my app for the last few versions. Terrible. Nothing comes up. Now even when I go to most recent nothing is coming up. To see anything in the app at the moment I have to go into people's profiles. This app has gone completely down hill over the last few months and is beginning to get really annoying. So annoying I might just come off it altogether..
facebook,ie,144.0,2,Since the latest update I find when I am scrolling through Facebook it is constantly jumping. For example if u are reading comments under a post it will just jump back to the top with no warning. It‚Äôs very annoying üò†

facebook,ie,143.0,1,Anytime you now watch a video bloody ads come up in the middle of it!!! This is very frustrating and was never the case a few months back!! Also if you watch or read an article they automatically like the page for you again this shouldn‚Äôt be the case
facebook,ie,142.0,1,"I do not like leaving negative reviews that could potentially turn off some people from using this app but the amount of negativity, fear mongering, invasive ads and overall information overload has led to me deleting this app from my iPhone forever. This isn't a 1 star review because ""notifications aren't working"" or ""the updates ruined it"" or other one off issues. It's 1 star because it has led to so much stress, anxiety, unnecessary outrage and a general negative mood. Maybe others will disagree but I despise FB"

facebook,ie,140.0,1,"The format is terrible and I now have a weird Instagram account associated with my account that I cannot remove. Removed Instagram from apps in the Facebook app no joy. Uninstalled both apps no joy, made sure there was no link on insta and still nothing. I've reached out to Facebook numerous times but nothing. I'm going to delete my account and the app altogether. Only put in 1 star because I have to buy this app deserves 0"

facebook,ie,140.0,5,So kool
facebook,ie,140.0,1,"They really shouldn't have changed the format on the iPhone, new layout is absolutely horrific, hate it altogether, if it ain't broke don't fix it, they have fallen into this fallacy, it's absolutely awful to use, why can't they just leave good and well alone, I'm actually in the process of uninstalling it from my phone due to the change, they messed up badly on this one!"
facebook,ie,139.0,5,Excellent app
facebook,ie,138.0,2,Honestly I think it's a good app but a lot of kids can get on to it they can make a email and fake their age I just wanna make sure because there's a lot of creepy things on here
facebook,ie,138.0,1,"My news feed was taken up by all of my favourite group posts last week, now they've all been taken away meaning I have to go to each group individually to see new posts from members. This needs to be fixed ASAP!"

facebook,ie,136.0,1,How the heck often are we to update your app? Weekly at .25 giga? Between this app and a few others like it your data plan is zeroed.. keep it simple Facebook. Stop trying to be all things to all men.

facebook,ie,134.0,2,Major flaw with the Facebook app is that you cannot toggle to positing as your Facebook public page. So we are forced to open up Safari and use the website instead. The app should facilitate this.

facebook,ke,251.0,1,"Hi Team,

This week‚Äôs app update isn‚Äôt working. I open the app and it shuts down itself without loading anything. Kindly fix this bug. 

Thank you!"
facebook,ke,249.0,3,The app accumulates lots of background data the app is about 230mbs but after using for about 2days the size it occupies will be about 700mbs and it keeps on piling. This is an issue especially if you are using IOS where space is an important issue. To solve this I have to keep deleting and reinstalling the app. It would be great if the app could allow clearing of such data either manually like in Safari or automatically. Over to you FACEBOOK developers

facebook,ke,6.2,3,"It seems that with each new release, the magic of Facebook keeps being lost. This version has way too many sponsored posts and not enough of my friends posts. It chooses what to display almost randomly and it feels like the point of Facebook has been lost. The app should be to allow you to know what your friends are doing. This has been lost. It's quite sad actually."

Just to let you know, I am running the latest update, and if I log on to my pc at hone my post is then there. So this must be a app problem.

facebook,za,275.0,1,I have always advertised my online shop on Facebook and never had problems but for some reason since last year i get jailed for posting to much apparently. Im not even posting in more groups its just the same ones and after im out of jail and i literally just comment something on a post they log me out of my account and message me saying they detected suspicious activity or a log in from an unkown location. My phone is the only active device and i never moved or changed locations. I did check there is no other devices logged in my account. I have been jailed 3 months now and probably 80% of the time last year yet when i pay Facebook to promote my adds they have no problem doing it and taking my money as if they are forcing me to pay them. Im deleting my account its worthless i cant even update my damm profile pic. Ironically when i report scammers they message me back saying they found nothing wrong. Very frustrated and i have been very patient but this was the last toll.

facebook,za,271.0,1,I tried to open my Facebook app now and when I did it automatically closed it and said I needed it to purchase it from App Store and then when App Store opened. It didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúbuy‚Äù it said ‚Äúopen‚Äù and it‚Äôs been an ongoing cycle. Please fix.
facebook,za,271.0,1,"What the hell are your development team doing?? I can‚Äôt even open the damn thing anymore, it says it‚Äôs no longer avalible, and I have to re-download it.

facebook,za,270.1,1,You‚Äôd expect an app of this calibre to have a decent update. But no it‚Äôs as pathetic as the ceo. How is it when I get notifications from groups it won‚Äôt show it but show someone else post that is a few hours old and not the new one?
facebook,za,270.0,1,"This app is absolutely rubbish for ipad. I really expected more from such a large company. I don‚Äôt know if its rivalry or just plain spitefullness towards apple products. Notifications don‚Äôt open on the correct post. It never has on ipad. When an update becomes available, then facebook seems to become extra annoying if you don't update immediately. Google products are the worst and needs constant updating because its always broken. As soon as things are working ok, then an update changes a lot of things. I wish they would stick to things that work, don‚Äôt fix it if its broken. Google, the annoying millions of updates company."
facebook,za,270.0,1,"On multiple occasions now my friends & I have reported a fake account that has been using my pictures to catfish others on Facebook. This has been going on for WEEKS & Facebook has done absolutely nothing about it !! This goes to show that the app DOES NOT have proper safety measures in place to protect people from such things. This is the highest act of fraud, someone has taken my identity. How do you know that the fake account isn‚Äôt luring youngsters in to commit a crime like robbery or rape ? Please fix your pathetic & worthless excuse for an app before someone pays the price for it."

It doesn‚Äôt display notifications properly, if many people have shared a post and click ‚ÄúSee more‚Äù to see everyone that has shared that post, it doesn‚Äôt load anything.

facebook,za,266.0,1,"This is great app 

I just wish they could allow us to: 

View messages within the app
Set default option to open links instead of forcing us to view them within the app
View updates and news feed in chronological order as they come in just like Twitter and Instagram.

Stop fixing what is not broken
Allows us to update profile and edit setting in the mobile browser as long I have login on primary device. 

Copy Twitter and other apps example since you won‚Äôt allow us to set browser as default app to open links rather makes it possible to apply browser tools to links that are open within the app such as reader mode and about to apply specific website settings.

facebook,za,257.0,1,It doesn‚Äôt make sense to download this app and messenger when you still have to open every link sent to you in messenger using Safari.

facebook,za,257.0,1,"Maybe you guys that are getting paid to do a job, should consider letting the rest of us know what is in each update. It's always the same ""cut and paste"" explanation that tells us NOTHING, and each update is the same size OR LARGER than the actual app. Please explain."

facebook,bs,6.1.1,5,FACEBOOK SUCKS...........NEEDS A LARGE SCALE OF IMPROVEMENTS IN MANY AREAS.............TOO MUCH PORN FOR ONE..........AND I THINK THE PROGRAMMERS NEED TO GROW UP............SCREENING WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO AND ALLOWING KIDS TO BE EXPOSED TO FILTHY MATERIAL...........DISGUSTED WITH THE SOCIAL NETWORK.

facebook,bs,6.0.2,5,"I love Facebook. The easy way to stay in touch with friends, and to vent about causes dear to me.
However, I am DISTRESSED by the cruelty that is posted - for example, 2 men standing next to a couple of dogs that they have hung by the throat from a tree, garnishing comments on Facebook. In my opinion, Facebook should not be a vessel for this kind of obscene cruelty. I hope you will reconsider removing these hateful people from your fantastic forum."

facebook,bz,5.0.1,4,I guess I'm going to say the same thing that most ppl said already. The update is pretty cool.

Hope not to far in the future they can implement the share button.
facebook,bz,5.0.1,4,I can't share things with my friends
facebook,bz,5.0,4,It works. What else is there to say? It annoys me that there's no share button and I have to go to safari to share stuff. Other than that it's fine.

I like that I can easily switch between my wall, news feed, groups and friends using the auto-hide sidebar. I haven't tried changing my privacy settings (e.g. for specific posts) or putting friends in specific lists, so i'm not sure how it measures up. But for all these reasons, I gave the app 4 out of 5 stars"

facebook,jm,5.0,5,"This shot, lovely to use very helpful and needed the best thing in recent times that came to technology...."
facebook,jm,5.0,1,Can't seem to tag people using the new updated app and it is also very hard to scroll my news feed now if there are photo updates with more that one photo. Speed improved but it takes a longer time to load the images on a slow connection compared to the last version. Like the new look and somewhat the way the scroll feels now but that is about it. Come on guys. I'm still unable to change for profile pic but take a photo right there from the app. Can do that with cover photos but not my profile pic. That is all. I'm not hating on you guys but come on I'm not impressed it sucks and for that I wish I could have had the option to give you negative 5 stars. Fix it!
facebook,jm,5.0,5,"Love the updates on the new app, very fast n much more user friendly. The updates to chat are great"

I love this new app, haven't been on Facebook via safari or google since it's been updated."

facebook,jm,4.0.2,5,This new version is very efficient and easy to use.
facebook,jm,4.0.2,5,"An excellent update to the previous version. This version is better and has a quicker ""turnaround"" time to view messages and notifications ."

facebook,jm,3.5,4,This is very slow and my chat box keep opening up and the board of apple will be notified by this problem so I need it to be changed asap unless the board will be notified and people will be losing there jobs
facebook,jm,3.3.3,5,"Best user-friendly Facebook application for iPods. However, could u guys add group chat under the groups section or the chat section for those who are in such groups and use the groupchat? That would be awesome.

Keep up the great work!"

facebook,jm,5.0,1,Can't seem to tag people using the new updated app and it is also very hard to scroll my news feed now if there are photo updates with more that one photo. Speed improved but it takes a longer time to load the images on a slow connection compared to the last version. Like the new look and somewhat the way the scroll feels now but that is about it. Come on guys. I'm still unable to change for profile pic but take a photo right there from the app. Can do that with cover photos but not my profile pic. That is all. I'm not hating on you guys but come on I'm not impressed it sucks and for that I wish I could have had the option to give you negative 5 stars. Fix it!
facebook,jm,5.0,5,"Love the updates on the new app, very fast n much more user friendly. The updates to chat are great"
facebook,jm,5.0,5,Love it!!!

facebook,jm,5.0,4,"I love it! It is sooo much easier n faster... I just wish I could update my cover photo on it, but otherwise no complaints!!!! I keep finding new features on it and honestly leaves me a bit mesmerised. The picture quality is incredible! And when zoomed in it's so clear and high def! I love this new app, haven't been on Facebook via safari or google since it's been updated."

facebook,jm,4.1.1,1,It keeps exiting !! Y ?
facebook,jm,4.1.1,3,"It could be better if it was faster; its really slow and needs to update,but if you have time and patients its a good app for you."

facebook,jm,4.0.2,5,This new version is very efficient and easy to use.
facebook,jm,4.0.2,5,"An excellent update to the previous version. This version is better and has a quicker ""turnaround"" time to view messages and notifications ."
facebook,jm,4.0,4,"jus got it I like the look especially the games add-on it crashed twice on me tho but no major complaints thus far keep up the work
ps u should have added the tweeter to the apps section"
facebook,jm,3.5,4,This is very slow and my chat box keep opening up and the board of apple will be notified by this problem so I need it to be changed asap unless the board will be notified and people will be losing there jobs
facebook,jm,3.3.3,5,"Best user-friendly Facebook application for iPods. However, could u guys add group chat under the groups section or the chat section for those who are in such groups and use the groupchat? That would be awesome.

Keep up the great work!"

Only downside is the restart of the fb app but that is only occasionally. Overall a great app."
facebook,pg,6.3,5,"It is a rather interesting site to visit. It never ceases to amuse, yet inform and astonish me, everytime I log in... I especially enjoy the fact that I could be able to keep in touch with my family and friends who I cannot reach via phone, where it is quite costly. Although there are times when I get really annoyed, but that is the whole idea of socializing and it's awesome. It's become more of a service than a leisure social networking site, seeing that it is much much more efficient in getting information such as news, etc to people faster, in other words it keeps people informed. Anyway, I love Facebook and would like to thank Facebook for just being Facebook... ;)"

facebook,lc,5.0,1,It's great for apple that the new iOS devices have more powerful processors but it is quite evil that you guys keep making these apps put a strain on the older devices (3GS) twisting our arms into getting newer devices...this app keeps crashing and is ridiculously slow on the 3GS...very nasty move developer!!!

facebook,tt,264.0,4,Keeps loading photos and not responding
facebook,tt,263.0,4,"I think that it will be very wise to create an option where users can delete more than one picture at once.

facebook,tt,51.0,1,The new update is TERRIBLE! The news feed now shows old feeds and nothing recent. The only way to see your most recent news feed is to go to the settings and change it EVERY SINGLE TIME. Why would you make this so unnecessarily tedious?!?!?!
facebook,tt,51.0,4,Hey Facebook is still annoying but I keeps the Feds happy.
facebook,tt,50.0,1,App is dull and boring no longer simple to use and looks ugly especially on the iPad and you don't even tell us in the App Store what's new in the update. You update you app every 2-3 weeks yet their is still issues with notification what the hell?

facebook,tt,14.9,1,This sucky app wants me to keep running updates but just gives a standard generic reasons for their updates. Should at least say why. Also they said updates every four weeks. Did they forget how to count because it's either every week or bi- weekly my phone has an update for this already sucky app
facebook,tt,14.9,1,Its a pain to use on my 5s.... It sticks for hours and it's uploading features are a little faulty... Come on FB.
facebook,tt,14.9,2,"Freezes. Stutters when scrolling and ""tap to return to top"" doesn't work. Somebody at Facebook Inc. needs to pay closer attention to this app. Come on people, this is an app for Apple users, at least try to keep up! Please fix the app!!!!"

facebook,tt,5.5,1,"No matter how much times I redownload it, it keeps freezing. And it doesnt unfreeze unless I delete it and download it ALL over again.

facebook,tt,5.4.2,4,"The option to send photo in message and voice note is excellent, but u guys need to improve on the option to delete ur messages and also to put a luck on the app other than ur account password."
facebook,tt,5.4.2,3,At first it was rell good but now it's sticking quite often and I have to close the app then open it again and wait for like 5 minutes for it to load. Also it does not give u the option to change your timeline so that's also a problem. But overall it's a pretty good app. It can be better upgraded tho. :)

facebook,tt,5.0.1,4,Fb app is great..... But would like the ability to share items
facebook,tt,5.0.1,4,"There r some things that mite be missing but it is still a great app, thank you!!!"
facebook,tt,5.0.1,1,How do I get this app on my 3gs phone
facebook,tt,5.0.1,2,For better performance I delete fb app and tried again...thy ask os 4.3 version...wat to do get d older version.pls provide me d version 4.i
facebook,tt,5.0.1,5,This is the best friend finder and advertiser EVER
facebook,tt,5.0.1,5,Great app it's just great.Keep the upgrades coming.
facebook,tt,5.0.1,5,I find the new app very mre faster & cool.. <3 it..!!
facebook,tt,5.0.1,1,App is not an improvement.
facebook,tt,5.0.1,4,It's a great app
facebook,tt,5.0.1,4,I love it
facebook,tt,5.0.1,4,Good app
facebook,tt,5.0.1,5,I luv it
facebook,tt,5.0.1,5,It's a great app
facebook,tt,5.0.1,4,This version is so much better
facebook,tt,5.0.1,4,Definitely better and faster than before but could use some more work...
facebook,tt,5.0.1,4,Cool app!!
facebook,tt,5.0.1,4,So far so good. Don't have any complaints
facebook,tt,5.0.1,5,Don't know what I would do with out it. I found friends I haven seen I years
facebook,tt,5.0.1,5,Great features an ease of use
facebook,tt,5.0.1,1,Poor poor
facebook,tt,5.0.1,4,Pretty good actually. Would be nice to be able to edit a comment after posting though as one is able to do accessing from a computer. Not seeing how to do so via the app. Only delete available or have to create new comment to correct spelling.
facebook,tt,5.0.1,4,Informative
facebook,tt,5.0.1,4,It works gr8 for me.
facebook,tt,5.0.1,1,It never starts! I have to uninstall it every single time then reinstall it....then it stops again. Come on apple it's a crappy app. Fix it.
facebook,tt,5.0.1,4,Facebook is great. But I'm learning how to use on iPad effectively. Photo downloads are difficult.
facebook,tt,5.0.1,3,"Look into the lack of sharing a photo button an cannot put up a cover photo
From this app"
facebook,tt,5.0.1,3,Good apart from the fact that uploading pictures are a pain since flash is not supported by Apple...
facebook,tt,5.0.1,4,Love the speed and the easy access! Four stars cause I know it can only get better from here ;)
facebook,tt,5.0.1,4,Ryan
facebook,tt,5.0.1,5,Love it
facebook,tt,5.0.1,5,Love it !!
facebook,tt,5.0.1,5,I like
facebook,tt,5.0.1,4,"If only it had the ability to share photos it would be great.
Still a good app though."
facebook,tt,5.0.1,5,It's great
facebook,tt,5.0.1,5,Best ever
facebook,tt,5.0.1,4,My only problem with it is that I can no longer change my cover photo from my phone.
facebook,tt,5.0.1,4,This app should definitely become a regular for non-tablet users. Multiple pages and quick recovery work for me. It's like a mind map all bringing you back to your initial page. Messages aren't delayed and there's a built in chat.
facebook,tt,5.0.1,4,Upgrade
facebook,tt,5.0.1,4,Much better than previous version. It's cool
facebook,tt,5.0.1,4,Pretty gd update

facebook,tt,5.0,5,Great!!!
facebook,tt,5.0,3,"Some nice updates, but want to be able to share."
facebook,tt,5.0,4,I really enjoy using it. I think that there are still some things to work out but it will get there!
facebook,tt,5.0,5,Using this app is the best lovingÓå©Óå≠it thank GodÓêù

facebook,tt,5.0,5,I like it...resisted at first but like it now.
facebook,tt,5.0,5,It's great and easy to use! As my predecessors before me said a need to share is important hope that would be included in your next update!

facebook,tt,5.0,4,Good app but some things can be better!
facebook,tt,5.0,3,"It's cool, would like the ability to delete feeds from my wall, if possible and refining of friend search - its a bit difficult for me to find friends outside of my friend list Besides that very stable and user friendly and balanced when viewing videos and photo albums. Chat is great as well. Good work facebook"
facebook,tt,5.0,5,Great and easy to use
facebook,tt,5.0,3,It needs to allow us to play games on fb!!!!!!!!
facebook,tt,5.0,4,"It's waay better than the previous one,downloading photos should be returned"
facebook,tt,5.0,3,"It's cool, good app"
facebook,tt,5.0,3,Not awesome but cool.
facebook,tt,5.0,5,"The BEST update yet, flows smooth and looks great."
facebook,tt,5.0,4,It's better than the last version but it's still missing a few things... Like a share button and show tags etc
facebook,tt,5.0,3,"I like the changes, the app is definitely faster HOWEVER the options to download pics, change prof pics/cover photos have been removed AND THAT SUCKSSSS... Pls put it back ;)"
facebook,tt,5.0,4,"Great app, easy to use and much faster"
facebook,tt,5.0,4,I like the changes u made; it's great but I don't like that I can't download a photo I like anymore directly from the app or change my profile pic from the app... I have to wait til I can get to a pc?!!!... Plz put the options back to download and change your profile pic! Thanks
facebook,tt,5.0,4,It is a very nice app I enjoy using it but I don't really understand like the button it had on pics to either save it or make it UR pro pic where did it go??! How do u save a pic now or make it UR pro pic ?!!!!!and also how do u change ur timeline pic frm the app ?!!? But other wise It is a wonderful app indeed I love it .
facebook,tt,5.0,5,100% fantastic now that those little areas of improvement are fixed... But I'm not seeing the button to change the cover photo anymore though; however great!!!
facebook,tt,5.0,5,This is the best version to date
facebook,tt,5.0,4,The updates are awesum bt stl wish that the chat could make u appear online instead of on mobile And also frm inbox messages u cud view that person profile that's all bt wel don wid da updates :)
facebook,tt,5.0,2,The interface is prettier but functionality wise I remain unimpressed. I prefer the functionality of the previous version
facebook,tt,5.0,3,"It still crashes every time I use it particularly when trying to view somebody else's profile page, I do like the new album viewing feature on the home feed and when it works the app is much faster. Summarily a positive move in the right direction but maybe an update or 2 before it is the app we expect from a company like Facebook."
facebook,tt,5.0,5,Very interactive
facebook,tt,5.0,4,It's about time. This update makes it tons easier to use. No lagging and moves a lot smoother. I like the chat and photo viewing options. Well done!
facebook,tt,5.0,5,Iz da shiet
facebook,tt,5.0,5,Perfect is really PERFECT
facebook,tt,5.0,4,It's about time they upgraded the fb app it's faster and better now.... Love the new fb chat as well with the icons installed in it!!!

facebook,tt,5.0,5,I love this new app!! So much easier to use!!! Would love the via iPad thingy also!!
facebook,tt,5.0,5,It's great
facebook,tt,4.1.1,5,At least it's better than android Facebook app :)
facebook,tt,4.1.1,3,Good
facebook,tt,4.1.1,2,"It would be a great app if not for the unbelievably annoying reminder to rate it that continuously pops up. I originally gave it a positive rating but I no longer have that opinion. As minor as it might seem, it's just as annoying as ads popping up with your every touch. I paid money for this thing, I shouldn't have to be bombarded by this freaking reminder, especially after doing what it asks. If it's a bug PLEASE fix it and i'll be more than happy to amend my opinion."
facebook,tt,4.1.1,2,chat not working it's taking long to load
facebook,tt,4.1.1,4,"It's the perfect app for FaceBook, except for the chat which glitches sometimes, and also not being able to get notifications sooner. Maybe it's just my iPad but so far it's excellent."
facebook,tt,4.1,5,Swell wonderfully app best app ever awesome app wonderfully
facebook,tt,4.1,2,I really don't like this app it works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't that is quite irritating this app sucks
