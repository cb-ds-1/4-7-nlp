    "This question uses the Apple App review dataset that you generated in the \"Pulling online data\" workshop. Your dataset should have at least 3-5 different applications, with data from a few countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.1** Using the bag-of-words or TF-IDF vector model (from SKLearn), cluster the reviews into 5 clusters. Measure the accuracy of the cluster overlap against the real review scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.2** Now use a sentence embedding using on of the `gensim` pre-trained word embedding models to achieve the same in clustering. Get the best classification accuracy score you can on the 5-star review scale targer using all unsupervised methods you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.3** Using any method you want (pre-trained models, dimensionality reduction, feature engineering, etc.) make the best **regression** model you can to predict the 5 star rating. Rate the accuracy in regression terms (mean squared error) and in classification terms (accuracy score, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.4** Do the same as in 1.3, but use a classification model. Are classification models better or worse to predict a 5-point rating scale? Explain in a few paragraphs and justify with metrics.\n"
